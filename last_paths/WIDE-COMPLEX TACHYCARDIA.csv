Assess hemodynamic stability,"QRS duration >160 ms, Right axis deviation >90°, V1: broad R >40 ms, delayed R to S duration >100 ms, V6: any Q wave, Negative concordance","Patient with WIDE-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA -> Stable -> Evidence of AV dissociation? -> No -> Differentiate between LBBB- and RBBB-type patterns and apply morphologic analysis -> V1 negative (LBBB) -> QRS duration >160 ms, Right axis deviation >90°, V1: broad R >40 ms, delayed R to S duration >100 ms, V6: any Q wave, Negative concordance"
