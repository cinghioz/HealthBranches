Patient with DYSPNEA,Consider cardiopulmonary exercise test,"Patient with DYSPNEA -> The initial assessment of a patient with dyspnea focuses on the history. -> More chronic dyspnea may be evaluated in a stepwise fashion in an outpatient setting. -> Physical examination helps guide further diagnostic studies. -> The first study in the evaluation of dyspnea is often a chest x-ray (CXR). This study can reveal underlying changes consistent with CHF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or interstitial lung disease. It can also demonstrate pleural effusions, which may have been suspected based on the physical examination, and masses, which may have gone undetected. At the same time, initial studies should include a CBC to assess for anemia as a cause of dyspnea. -> Nonpulmonary causes -> Other nonpulmonary causes include metabolic derangements and anemia. -> Normal -> Consider cardiopulmonary exercise test||Patient with DYSPNEA -> The initial assessment of a patient with dyspnea focuses on the history. -> More chronic dyspnea may be evaluated in a stepwise fashion in an outpatient setting. -> Physical examination helps guide further diagnostic studies. -> The first study in the evaluation of dyspnea is often a chest x-ray (CXR).
