Patient with signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction,Revascularization as indicated,"Patient with signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction -> 12-lead ECG. Brief, targeted history -> Initial nursing care: cardiac monitor, oxygen, IV with D5W, initial blood tests, nitroglycerin (unless hypotension), aspirin. Initial physician evaluation: history, physical examination, ECG interpretation -> Patient with likely STEMI? -> Yes - Assess: time since symptom onset, risk of STEMI, risk of fibrinolysis, transfer to skilled PCI center -> Initial medical therapy: morphine, aspirin, antithrombin, nitrates (for chest discomfort), beta blockers -> Choice of reperfusion strategy -> Invasive strategy is preferred if: skilled PCI laboratory is available with door to balloon time anticipated <60 min, medical contact to balloon time anticipated <90 min, surgical backup available, high-risk STEMI (cardiogenic shock, Killip class â‰¥3), contraindication to fibrinolysis, late presentation (symptom onset >3 hr), diagnosis of STEMI is uncertain -> Premedication: aspirin if not already given, clopidogrel loading dose, consider glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor -> Cardiac catheterization -> Revascularization as indicated"
