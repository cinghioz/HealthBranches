Patient with CONSTIPATION,Surgical intervention or other specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease,"Evaluation of a patient with constipation -> Initial evaluation including patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests looking for heme-positive stool or rectal bleeding -> Perform diagnostic imaging to further investigate the cause of constipation -> Presence of an anorectal disorder requiring specific therapy -> Surgical intervention or other specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease||Evaluation of a patient with constipation -> Initial evaluation including patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests looking for heme-positive stool or rectal bleeding -> Perform diagnostic imaging to further investigate the cause of constipation -> Normal biopsy result. Could be other causes -> Study to evaluate colonic transit time -> Delayed transit time through the colon. Evaluate for slow transit constipation -> Surgical intervention or other specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease||Evaluation of a patient with constipation -> Initial evaluation including patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests looking for heme-positive stool or rectal bleeding -> Perform diagnostic imaging to further investigate the cause of constipation -> Normal biopsy result. Could be other causes -> Study to evaluate colonic transit time -> Abnormalities detected. Specific therapy for anoretcal disorder -> Surgical intervention or other specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease||Evaluation of a patient with constipation -> Initial evaluation including patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests looking for heme-positive stool or rectal bleeding -> Perform diagnostic imaging to further investigate the cause of constipation -> Normal biopsy result. Could be other causes -> Study to evaluate colonic transit time -> Abnormalities detected. Specific therapy for anoretcal disorder -> Evaluate anorectal function -> Abnormal motility study. Perform specific therapy -> Surgical intervention or other specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease||Evaluation of a patient with constipation -> Initial evaluation including patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests looking for heme-positive stool or rectal bleeding -> Perform diagnostic imaging to further investigate the cause of constipation -> Normal biopsy result. Could be other causes -> Further assess anorectal function. Perform defecography to assess the anorectal region further -> Abnormalities detected.
