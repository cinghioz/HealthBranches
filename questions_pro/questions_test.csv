What is the most likely underlying cause of the prolonged PT and PTT?","Multiple factor deficiencies (single, inherited factor deficiency of common pathway [II, V, X] or multiple acquired deficiencies [liver disease, DIC, vitamin K deficiency])","['Factor VII deficiency', 'Lupus anticoagulant', 'Heparin contamination', 'Factor VIII deficiency', 'Multiple factor deficiencies (single, inherited factor deficiency of common pathway [II, V, X] or multiple acquired deficiencies [liver disease, DIC, vitamin K deficiency])']",E,"Prolonged clotting times (PTT, PT, TT) -> No or unknown history of bleeding -> Unknown etiology -> Repeat test with equal mixture of patient's and ""normal"" plasma -> PT 1 PTT -> Inhibitor mix - Correction -> Factor deficiency (single, inherited factor deficiency of common pathway [II, V, X] or multiple acquired deficiencies [liver disease, DIC, vitamin K deficiency])",coagulation abnormalities
A 45-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to the emergency department with spontaneous bleeding and prolonged PT and PTT times of unknown etiology. Initial mixing studies with normal plasma fail to correct the prolonged coagulation times. What is the most likely underlying cause?,Lupus-like inhibitor,"['Factor VII deficiency', 'Factor VIII deficiency', 'Vitamin K deficiency', 'Heparin contamination', 'Lupus-like inhibitor']",E,"Prolonged clotting times (PTT, PT, TT) -> History of bleeding spontaneously or after surgery or trauma -> Unknown etiology -> Repeat test with equal mixture of patient's and ""normal"" plasma -> PT 1 PTT -> Inhibitor mix - No correction -> Inhibitor (most likely lupuslike)",coagulation abnormalities
A 58-year-old woman with no significant past medical history is found to have prolonged PT and PTT during routine preoperative testing. She denies any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. Initial mixing studies fail to correct the prolonged PT and PTT. What is the most likely underlying cause?,Lupus-like inhibitor,"['Factor VII deficiency', 'Factor VIII deficiency', 'Vitamin K deficiency', 'Liver disease', 'Lupus-like inhibitor']",E,"Prolonged clotting times (PTT, PT, TT) -> No or unknown history of bleeding -> Unknown etiology -> Repeat test with equal mixture of patient's and ""normal"" plasma -> PT 1 PTT -> Inhibitor mix - No correction -> Inhibitor (most likely lupuslike)",coagulation abnormalities
