A 54-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with confusion and diaphoresis. His wife reports that he took his usual dose of insulin this morning but skipped breakfast. A point-of-care glucose test reveals a blood glucose level of 55 mg/dL. What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypoglycemia?,"Review the patient's medication list and recent blood glucose logs, and consider adjusting the insulin dosage or timing to prevent future episodes of hypoglycemia.","['Administer intravenous glucagon and monitor for improvement', 'Provide the patient with a high-carbohydrate snack and reassess blood glucose in 15 minutes', 'Immediately order a CT scan of the head to rule out other causes of altered mental status', 'Start an insulin infusion to tightly control blood glucose levels', 'Review the patient's medication list and recent blood glucose logs, and consider adjusting the insulin dosage or timing to prevent future episodes of hypoglycemia.']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Patient is diabetic -> Seek contributing factors or adjust insulin dosing,hypoglycemia
A 50-year-old male with no prior history of diabetes presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. His friend reports that he has been drinking heavily for the past few days and has not eaten much. A blood glucose test reveals a level of 52 mg/dL. Which of the following medications could potentially be contributing to his hypoglycemia?,Ethanol,"['Insulin', 'Metformin', 'Lisinopril', 'Levothyroxine', 'Ethanol']",E,"Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Drug effect: Ethanol, Salicylates, Haloperidol, Pentamidine, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole",hypoglycemia
"A 50-year-old male with no prior history of diabetes presents to the emergency department with recurrent episodes of confusion and sweating, particularly in the morning. His blood glucose at the time of presentation is 52 mg/dL. Further investigation reveals a fasting glucose level of 40 mg/dL, elevated insulin levels, but suppressed C-peptide levels. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his hypoglycemia?",Exogenous insulin use,"['Insulinoma', 'Sulfonylurea overdose', 'Ethanol abuse', 'Adrenal insufficiency', 'Exogenous insulin use']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Patient not known to be diabetic -> Fasting glucose <45 mg/dl -> Insulin levels >6 μU/ml -> C-peptide <200 mg/dl -> Exogenous insulin,hypoglycemia
"A 50-year-old male with no known history of diabetes is admitted to the hospital for recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. His blood glucose is found to be 52 mg/dL. Further laboratory tests reveal elevated insulin and C-peptide levels, and a positive sulfonylurea screen. What is the most likely cause of his hypoglycemia?",Sulfonylurea effect,"['Ethanol abuse', 'Insulinoma', 'Adrenal insufficiency', 'Reactive hypoglycemia', 'Sulfonylurea effect']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Patient not known to be diabetic -> Fasting glucose <45 mg/dl -> Insulin levels >6 μU/ml -> C-peptide >200 mg/dl -> Positive Sulfonylurea screen -> Sulfonylurea effect,hypoglycemia
"A 30-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of sweating, tremor, and confusion. His symptoms appear unrelated to meals and have been increasing in frequency. He is not known to have diabetes. Initial lab results show a glucose level of 50 mg/dL. After a supervised fasting test, his glucose drops to 40 mg/dL, insulin levels are elevated at 8 μU/mL, C-peptide is 300 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screen is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Insulinoma,"['Reactive hypoglycemia', 'Sulfonylurea overdose', 'Ethanol-induced hypoglycemia', 'Adrenal insufficiency', 'Insulinoma']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Patient not known to be diabetic -> Fasting glucose <45 mg/dl -> Insulin levels >6 μU/ml -> C-peptide >200 mg/dl -> Negative Sulfonylurea screen -> Insulinoma,hypoglycemia
"A 50-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of sweating, tremor, and confusion, particularly in the morning. He denies any history of diabetes or use of hypoglycemic agents. Initial lab results reveal a glucose level of 58 mg/dL. Further testing during a supervised fast shows a glucose level of 42 mg/dL, insulin levels of 5 μU/mL, and negative sulfonylurea screen. What is the most likely underlying cause of his hypoglycemia?",IGF-mediated Noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia,"['Exogenous insulin administration', 'Sulfonylurea overdose', 'Insulinoma', 'Ethanol-induced hypoglycemia', 'IGF-mediated Noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Patient not known to be diabetic -> Fasting glucose <45 mg/dl -> Insulin levels <6 μU/ml -> IGF-mediated Noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia,hypoglycemia
"A 50-year-old woman with a history of bariatric surgery presents with recurrent episodes of sweating, anxiety, and palpitations approximately 2 hours after meals. A blood glucose test during one of these episodes reveals a glucose level of 55 mg/dL. What is the most likely next step in the management of this patient?",Refer the patient for evaluation for potential surgical intervention.,"['Administer intravenous dextrose during symptomatic episodes.', 'Prescribe a continuous glucose monitor to track glucose fluctuations.', 'Recommend frequent small meals throughout the day.', 'Adjust the timing and dosage of her diabetes medications.', 'Refer the patient for evaluation for potential surgical intervention.']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Postprandial hypoglycemia -> Surgery,hypoglycemia
"A 50-year-old male with a history of obesity and recent bariatric surgery presents with sweating, anxiety, and palpitations approximately 2 hours after meals. A point-of-care glucose test reveals a blood sugar level of 58 mg/dL. Based on the context, what is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?",Early diabetes,"['Reactive hypoglycemia', 'Insulinoma', 'Adrenal insufficiency', 'Ethanol-induced hypoglycemia', 'Early diabetes']",E,Symptoms -> Confirm glucose <60 mg/dl -> Postprandial hypoglycemia -> Early diabetes,hypoglycemia
