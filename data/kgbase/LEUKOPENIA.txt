LEUKOPENIA

In adults leukopenia is a total WBC count !3700 cells/
mm3. Most cases result from absolute neutropenia
(!2500 cells/mm3); rare cases are secondary to absolute
lymphopenia (!1000 cells/mm3).
A. Initial evaluation should include a thorough history
and physical examination. Give special attention to
the use of drugs and the presence of adenopathy,
splenomegaly, ecchymoses, petechiae, and signs of
infection. CBC, differential, and platelet counts are
essential to determine absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and to rule out any accompanying
anemia or thrombocytopenia. The blood smear provides important information concerning RBC and
WBC morphology. The results of these tests often
lead to specific diagnoses.
B. Patients with neutropenia usually have signs and symptoms of infection that often are life threatening. Fever
in the absence of localizing signs of infection is common. After obtaining cultures, start broad-spectrum
antibiotics immediately.
C. Isolated neutropenia and pancytopenia can occur with
many commonly used noncytotoxic drugs (e.g., quinidine, penicillins, sulfonamides, phenothiazines, diuretics), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and other neoplastic agents. If physical examination and laboratory
test results are negative for a neoplastic or hematologic
disorder, stop the drug and observe the patient by taking
frequent blood counts. Order a bone marrow biopsy and
aspirate if the neutropenia fails to resolve in 5–7 days or
if blood counts continue to decline.
D. Disorders leading to splenomegaly with splenic sequestration can cause neutropenia, but there usually is
associated thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnosis includes cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, glycogen storage diseases,
and other uncommon conditions.
E. If the bone marrow result is unremarkable and there
is no evidence of splenomegaly or an autoimmune

disorder, consider rare chronic neutropenic states.
Observe the patient with serial blood counts to document the neutropenic pattern.
Most cases of neutropenia are associated with anemia
and/or thrombocytopenia. Unless a drug is strongly
suspected as the cause, order a bone marrow biopsy
and aspirate to rule out a primary hematologic disorder
that requires prompt treatment.
If the only bone marrow abnormality is the absence of
mature granulocytes, this suggests maturation arrest or
autoimmune destruction. Perform a workup for an
autoimmune disorder. If available, an antineutrophil
antibody assay may be helpful.
Infections that can cause neutropenia with anemia and/
or thrombocytopenia include viruses (Epstein-Barr,
cytomegalovirus, virus HIV, hepatitis, measles); bacteria
(severe gram-negative and gram-positive organisms);
Mycobacterium, typhoid fever, malaria; and fungi. Bone
marrow should be cultured as part of an extensive
workup for infection.
Lymphopenia without associated neutropenia is uncommon. Most cases are secondary to drugs (e.g., steroids),
radiation injury, or renal failure. Some viral infections,
particularly HIV, can also cause absolute lymphopenia.
