A. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m² or structural/functional abnormalities of the kidney for ≥3 months; kidney disease <3 months' duration should be evaluated as acute renal failure. The evaluation of the patient with CKD should begin by verifying the duration of kidney damage and identifying potentially reversible causes. Renal ultrasonography should be performed in all patients to rule out obstruction, which is a potentially reversible cause of kidney disease. Important elements of the past medical history that may provide a clue to the cause of kidney disease include type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatologic diseases, malignancy, previous surgery involving the urinary system, viral hepatitis or HIV infection, kidney stones, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Medication history should include over-the-counter and herbal preparations. The review of systems should focus on recent infections; rash; arthralgias or arthritis; and uremic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sleep difficulties, poor appetite, and abnormal taste. The family history may provide important information such as the possibility of polycystic kidney disease, Fabry's disease, and medullary cystic disease. Laboratory evaluation should include serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, urinalysis, urine protein:creatinine, and examination of the urine sediment. More targeted laboratory investigations such as ANAs, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, complement levels, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cryoglobulins, and antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies should be undertaken in patients with a suggestive history, laboratory results, or urine sediment. Kidney biopsy can provide definitive diagnosis in patients for whom a diagnosis would alter treatment recommendations or inform prognosis.
B. Potentially reversible causes of CKD include obstructive uropathy, drug-induced interstitial nephritis, Fabry's disease, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and certain vasculitides and glomerulonephritides.
C. Serum creatinine should be used to determine the estimated GFR (eGFR) by the following formula: 186 × creatinine-1.154 × age-0.203 (× 0.742 if female and × 1.212 if black). Stage 1 CKD is defined as normal or elevated GFR (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m²) with kidney damage noted radiographically or on urinalysis (e.g., proteinuria, red cell casts). CKD stages 2-5 are defined as GFR 60–89, 30–59, 15-29, and <15 ml/min/1.73 m² (or dialysis), respectively. Medications should be reviewed in patients with reduced eGFR and adjusted accordingly.
D. CKD may progress toward end-stage renal disease. Known risk factors include proteinuria, uncontrolled hypertension, smoking, and obesity. Blood pressure should be treated to below 130/80 mm/Hg. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be used, particularly in patients with proteinuria. Diuretics are often required for blood pressure control in patients with CKD. The role of dietary protein intake is controversial. Consultation with a nutritionist is recommended, particularly for patients with stage 3 and higher CKD. Patients with stage 4 CKD should be prepared for the possibility of kidney replacement therapy and referred to a surgeon for evaluation of vascular access for hemodialysis or peritoneal catheter placement for peritoneal dialysis; early referral to a kidney transplant center or specialist is recommended.
E. CKD is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Patients with CKD stages 1–4 should be considered in the highest-risk category for cardiovascular disease risk-reduction strategies. These include treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, physical activity, smoking cessation, and use of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering drugs in appropriate patients.
F. Anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism frequently accompany CKD, particularly in its later stages. Hemoglobin and iron indices should be checked regularly in patients with CKD. Recombinant erythropoietin or related analogs should be used to treat anemia; oral and/or IV iron may be necessary for iron deficiency. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes dietary modification and the use of oral phosphate binders. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is treated by controlling hyperphosphatemia and replacement of vitamin D with either 25-vitamin D (in deficient patients) or 1,25-vitamin D or its analogs.
