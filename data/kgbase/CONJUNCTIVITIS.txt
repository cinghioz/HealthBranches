A. Chronic conjunctivitis lasting >4 weeks has a large differential, and therefore patients with chronic conjunctivitis should be referred to an ophthalmologist.
B. The acute mucopurulent discharge of bacterial conjunctivitis is typically yellowish-white, thick, and creamy. This is in contrast to the thin, grayish-white, watery, or stringy mucus seen in nonbacterial conjunctivitis.
C. Concerning history includes contact lens wear, recent eye surgery or any history of glaucoma surgery, or any history or symptoms of sexually transmitted disease. These patients should be referred immediately to ophthalmology for further evaluation.
D. If there is no prior or concerning history, the discharge should be cleaned from the eye with frequent flushing using artificial tears and warm compresses to the lids. Antibacterial drops should be given QID for 1 week, with polymyxin-trimethoprim or a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone.
E. Viral conjunctivitis is typically associated with an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and tender swollen preauricular nodes. Because viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious when the discharge is present, meticulous hygiene should be maintained with frequent hand-washing, avoidance of touching the eyes, and avoidance of sharing towels or linens. Cool compresses and artificial tears can provide symptomatic relief.
F. If conjunctivitis is associated with vesicles of the periocular skin, an ophthalmologist should be consulted to evaluate for more extensive herpetic ocular involvement.
G. Allergic conjunctivitis is typically bilateral, with significant itching and watery discharge. Systemic antihistamines and allergen exposure control are helpful. Cool compresses and artificial tears may be sufficient for mild symptoms. Topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor drops QID (over the counter) can be used for a few weeks, but chronic use may cause rebound hyperemia and tachyphylaxis. Alternatively, topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor/mast cell stabilizer drops QD-bid can be prescribed for use as needed.
