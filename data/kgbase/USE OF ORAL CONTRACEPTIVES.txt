USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Early studies found that oral contraceptives (OCs), which
had a greater amount of estrogen, were associated with serious adverse outcomes. Today’s low-dose formulations retain
efficacy while minimizing side effects and have an overall
lower risk of cardiovascular disease. OCs contain synthetic
estrogens and progestins. They differ in dosage, proportion of active ingredients, and prescribed regimens. Effectiveness, safety, and patient acceptability are important in
selection of OC products. Provide a product that offers
the lowest effective dose of both hormones and minimizes
side effects. Data are not available for determining which
OC is “better”; cost considerations should be included in
product selection.
A. Before prescribing an OC, obtain a complete history,
including history of previous contraceptive use and
failures or adverse effects of previously used methods;
menstrual history, focusing on patterns and problems;
history of blood clots and tobacco use; gynecologic and
obstetric history; family history of coagulopathy; and
general medical history. Perform a complete physical
examination in which risk factors are assessed and contraindications to OC use determined. Order appropriate laboratory tests as necessary.
B. Monophasic pills contain a constant estrogen and progestin dose. Biphasic products contain a constant dose
of estrogen, with a lower progestin dose on days 1–10
than on days 11–21. Triphasic pills have varied amounts
of hormones; Ortho-Novum 777, Tri-Levlen, TriCyclen, and Triphasil have an increase of progestin
at midcycle and end cycle; Tri-Norinyl has increased
progestin only at midcycle. Ortho-Novum 777, TriCyclen, and Tri-Norinyl have fixed amounts of estrogen; Triphasil and Tri-Levlen have increased estrogen
at midcycle. These differences in triphasic pills are
generally insignificant in most women who do not have
specific problems or menstrual irregularities.
Ethinyl estradiol (EE) and mestranol are the two
estrogen agents used in OCs. EE is pharmacologically
active and mestranol is hepatically converted to EE.
Progestins used in OCs include norethindrone, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, dl-norgestrel,
norethynodrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, and norgestimate. Norethindrone acetate and ethynodiol diacetate
are metabolized to norethindrone and offer no significant advantage over norethindrone. dl-Norgestrel

616

and levonorgestrel are isomers, levonorgestrel being
the active component. Some studies suggest that
dl-norgestrel has little pharmacologic activity, but
others state that it prevents breakthrough bleeding
(BTB) more effectively. Norgestrel, levonorgestrel, and
desogestrel have the highest progestational effects.
Norethynodrel has the highest estrogenic effects with
all others having minimal to no estrogenic effects. The
greatest androgenic effects are seen by norgestrel and
levonorgestrel.
Estrogen is the major determinant for inducing increases in blood pressure (BP); however, progestins
also may be associated. Carbohydrate and lipid alternations are caused by the progestin component in OCs.
Desogestrel, norgestimate, and low doses of norethindrone have little if any effects on carbohydrate metabolism. Progestins decrease high-density lipoproteins
(HDLs) and increase low-density lipoproteins (LDLs);
estrogens have the opposite effect.
A back-up method of birth control is recommended
with the first cycle of OCs. Compliance is important
for low-dose OCs because missed pills often lead to
breakthrough ovulation.
C. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that nonsmoking healthy women aged
35–44 years may continue using OCs. However,
women with preexisting diseases that affect the cardiovascular system should not use OCs. Use clinical
judgment in deciding whether any woman with cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia) should
use OCs. Some studies of low-dose OCs show no increased risk of cardiovascular complications; however,
OCs are currently considered synergistic in increased
risk, and each patient must be carefully evaluated for
OC use. Follow and monitor patients closely, and offer alternative contraceptive methods when indicated,
especially for smokers !35 years of age.
D. Progestin-only pills, or “mini-pills,” have lower effectiveness than combination OCs (COCs) because ovulation is not consistently inhibited. Progestin-only pills
are taken every day of the month, without a break for
withdrawal bleeding. Up to two thirds of users experience menstrual irregularities, BTB, and amenorrhea.
Mini-pills also are used in lactating women.

E. There is some concern about infant exposure to estrogens. Some believe this exposure is not clinically significant; others advocate waiting until an infant is
weaned before instituting OC use. The pill may diminish the protein content and volume of breast milk. The
FDA recommends deferring the use of OCs until a
baby is weaned.
F. Diabetic patients whose diabetes is controlled may
take low-dose OCs. Products with norethindrone,
desogestrel, or norgestimate are least likely to alter
glucose tolerance. Pregnancy prevention needs to be
weighted against the risk of pregnancy, and the risk of
fetal malformations in poorly controlled diabetic pregnancies.
G. ACHES is a mnemonic commonly used to help remember possible adverse effects of OCs: A, abdominal
pain (gallbladder disease, hepatic adenoma, pancreatitis, blood clot); C, chest pain (pulmonary embolism,
myocardial infarction); H, headaches (stroke, migraines,
hypertension); E, eye problems (hypertension, stroke);
S, severe leg pain (venous thromboembolism). COCs
have relative estrogen dominance, and estrogen-related
side effects can be expected to predominate. Familiarization with symptoms of estrogen/progestin excess/deficiency will aid in OC adjustments. Symptoms of estrogen excess include nausea, breast tenderness, fluid
retention, cervical mucorrhea, and cyclic headaches,
whereas estrogen deficiency is suggested by early or
midcycle BTB, increased spotting, and hypomenorrhea. Symptoms of progestin excess are increased appetite, depression, fatigue, acne, diabetogenic effects,
and decreased libido; symptoms of progestin deficiency
include late-cycle BTB, amenorrhea, and hypermenorrhea. An excess of both hormones can cause headaches,
weight gain, and hypertension. Many symptoms occurring in the first cycle of OC use improve by the second
or third cycle.
H. Lowering the potency of OCs for greater safety
has led to an increased incidence of BTB. BTB is common in the first few cycles of OC use.
I. Estrogens are conjugated in the liver and hydrolyzed by
intestinal bacteria. Any drug that affects these two systems may lead to decreased OC efficacy.
J. The absence of withdrawal bleeding may be the result
of insufficient endometrial development. Switching to
an OC with greater progestin content may resolve the
problem.
K. An increase in BP may be seen even in normotensive
patients. Increases can occur 1–36 months after initiation of the OC. The risk is lower with low-dose OCs.
Patients who are started on OCs should be checked for
BP changes within the first month. When hypertension
is associated with an OC, it is reversible. Monitor any
patient who develops hypertension while taking OCs

closely for the development of OC-associated complications. A return to normal BP after discontinuation of
OC may take 3–6 months.
Breast tenderness usually is caused by cyclic fluid retention or growth of breast tissue. An OC with lower
estrogenic activity or greater progestational activity or
an OC with less estrogen and less progestin may alleviate the tenderness. If tenderness persists, a progestinonly pill may be tried.
Nausea may occur often during the first few cycles of
OC use or may occur with the first few pills of each cycle. Many patients can prevent nausea by taking the pill
with food or at bedtime. If nausea persists, an OC with
lower estrogenic activity (as little as 20 $g in severe
cases) may bring relief. Vomiting is rare. If vomiting occurs within 2 hours after taking the OC, the dose should
be repeated to ensure contraception.
Weight loss and gain occur with equal frequency in OC
users. Most weight changes are unrelated to OC use.
However, estrogen can cause cyclic weight gain as a
result of fluid retention, and progestins can stimulate
appetite and insulin release.
There is an increased risk of stroke in OC users with a
history of migraine. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
must be ruled out in all OC users who have migraine
headaches. Vascular (migrainelike) headaches generally do not improve with a change in OC; these patients need to consider alternative contraceptive
methods. Headaches accompanied by fluid retention
(edema, breast enlargement, cyclic weight gain) may
be caused by both estrogens and progestins. Prescribe
an OC with lower estrogenic or progestational activity
and follow the patient closely to ensure resolution of
symptoms after one or two cycles.
Depression may be caused by an excess of estrogen or
progestin or by a deficiency of estrogen. If switching to
an OC with lower estrogenic or progestational activity
does not alleviate the depression, the pill should be
discontinued for three to six cycles and reevaluation
performed at that time.
