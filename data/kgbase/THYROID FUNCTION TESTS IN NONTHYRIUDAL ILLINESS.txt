In hospitalized patients the incidence of true hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is <1%. Clinical signs of thyroid disease may be masked in acutely ill patients. Conversely, some signs of severe illness mimic changes seen in thyroid diseases. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) radioimmunoassay (RIA) usually is decreased in patients with acute illness. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) also usually is normal. It may be difficult to identify acutely ill patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease. A sensitive TSH (sTSH) >10 μU/ml and low free thyroxine (T4) (FT4) are good evidence for primary thyroid failure.
A. The TSH and free thyroxine index (FTI) are the preferred tests for assessing the thyroxine level in this setting.
B. Up to 50% of acutely ill patients have a decrease in total T4 and/or T3. Both FT4 and sTSH usually are normal, although they can be suppressed. The more severe the illness, the more likely TSH and FTI suppression will be noted.
In the setting of acute illness, repeating thyroid function tests is very useful every 7–10 days. Thyroid test abnormalities will improve in parallel with the patient's improving condition. The converse is true as well.
Numerous studies have documented that levothyroxine therapy does not improve the outcome of patients with thyroid function abnormalities attributable to nonthyroidal illness.
C. Patients with nephrotic syndrome may have mildly depressed FT4 and normal sTSH. Glucocorticoids in stress doses acutely inhibit TSH secretion, and a small decrement in both sTSH and FT4 may be observed. Dopamine infusions also cause acute suppression of TSH. In a truly hypothyroid patient receiving a dopamine infusion and/or stress doses of glucocorticoids, the TSH may be suppressed into the normal range.
D. Elevation of sTSH with normal FT4 is found in patients recovering from a nonthyroidal illness. sTSH usually is <20 μU/ml. Slight elevations of TSH commonly are found in patients with chronic renal failure. Although the pathophysiology is unknown, these patients have a blunted TSH response to TRH.
