A. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any unexpected, unintended, undesired, or excessive response to a drug or medication that (1) requires discontinuing the medication; (2) requires changing the medication; (3) requires modifying the dosage; (4) necessitates hospital admission; (5) prolongs stay in a health care facility; (6) necessitates supportive treatment; (7) significantly complicates diagnosis; (8) negatively affects prognosis; or (9) results in temporary or permanent harm, disability, or death. The concept of medication misadventures includes medication errors and ADRs. ADRs are far more common than many clinicians believe. A recent meta-analysis of 39 prospective studies concluded that serious ADRs occur in 6.7% of hospitalized patients, with a fatality rate of 0.32%. Annually, 2.2 million hospitalized patients experience serious ADRs, with 106,000 deaths per year, making ADRs the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The elderly are especially prone to ADRs. Approximately 5% of hospitalizations result from an ADR. It is estimated that 11% of hospitalized patients experience an ADR, with 2.1% of those considered serious. Many ADRs are preventable.
B. Evaluate any patient receiving a pharmacologically active substance (including diagnostic agents and alternative products) who has any adverse event for a possible ADR. Medication errors, including improper prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a drug, are one possible cause of ADRs. Standard drug information resources can help define the adverse effect profile of a given agent. However, information regarding newly marketed agents may be difficult to obtain.
C. Establishing a temporal association is often the most difficult part of the evaluation. Most ADRs manifest within the first day or two of treatment and most by the second week of therapy. The temporal relationship is drug, patient, and reaction specific. To establish a clear-cut temporal relationship, compare the time of onset of the reaction with that expected based on previous reported reaction or the known or proposed pathophysiologic mechanism. If the reaction has not been seen with the suspected drug, compare similar agents or drugs within the same class. Take into account patient specificity (e.g., type I hypersensitivity reactions may be immediate in nature in a patient who was previously exposed or delayed 5â€“10 days in a patient who has never been exposed).
D. Discontinue all potential offending agents, if possible. However, the decision to discontinue agents depends on the severity of the reaction, the effectiveness of the agent, the need for continued therapy, and the availability of therapeutic alternatives. If an alternative agent is used, choose one that is unlikely to cause the same ADR.
E. Like the onset of a reaction, resolution varies according to the specific nature of the reaction and the patient. Be aware that some adverse reactions, such as ototoxicity from aminoglycosides or nephrotoxicity from amphotericin B, may resolve only after long periods or may have permanent sequelae.
F. Rechallenge should not be undertaken unless the benefits outweigh the risks and should not be used merely to confirm the association between the ADR and the suspected drug. Be aware that there may be a different manifestation of the adverse reaction on rechallenge, particularly in cases of allergic reactions. These changes may be in the temporal relationship or in the severity of the reaction.
G. A variety of protocols are available to formally assess the probability and severity of an ADR. Unless the cause of the reaction is common and unambiguous, it may be helpful to apply one of these assessment protocols to the patient situation.
H. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MedWatch program is a voluntary system to report adverse events and products problems. The FDA is especially interested in serious or unusual reactions, reactions to new drugs, and reactions to herbal and other alternative medicine products. MedWatch reports can be submitted by fax (1-800-FDA-0178), by mail, or on-line (www.fda.gov/medwatch/). Vaccine-related ADRs should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at 1-800-822-7967.
