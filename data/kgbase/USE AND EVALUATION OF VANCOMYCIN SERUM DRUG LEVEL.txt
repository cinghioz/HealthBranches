A. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic introduced in the 1950s for gram-positive bacterial infections. Although once referred to as “Mississippi mud" for its muddy consistency (fermentation broth impurities), improved purification methods have changed both the appearance and adverse event profile of this drug. With its improved safety profile and the increasing incidence of multi-drug-resistant organisms, vancomycin use in both empiric and organism-specific treatment has increased. When using vancomycin empirically, it is important to consider the probable organism, local susceptibility patterns, and nationally recognized guidelines. After the need for vancomycin therapy has been determined, the need for vancomycin serum drug level (VSDL) monitoring must be decided. Although many clinicians still maintain the importance of monitoring vancomycin VSDLs, it is important to consider clinical outcomes when determining the need for VSDL monitoring. Relatively healthy patients requiring short-term therapy may not require a VSDL, whereas VSDL monitoring may be indicated in patients with renal insufficiency requiring long-term therapy and those who have unstable renal function or those with difficult-to-treat infections.
B. VSDL monitoring commonly consists of trough levels and occasionally peak levels. The utility of peak levels is controversial; however, peak levels are obtained 30-90 minutes after the end of an infusion. Trough VSDLs are obtained within 60 minutes prior to the next dose. It is recommended that VSDLs be obtained after the drug has reached steady state. Patient-specific parameters such as renal function, age, weight, site of infection, comorbidities, and route of administration should be included in VSDL evaluations (see Use and Evaluation of Serum Drug Levels for more details).
C. A patient's clinical response to vancomycin therapy is more important than whether a VSDL is within a standard therapeutic range (see Use and Evaluation of Serum Drug Levels for more details).
D. If a patient's abnormal WBC count, temperature, imaging studies, and other indicators of infection are not resolving within a reasonable time period, vancomycin therapy may need to be intensified or it may not be adequate antimicrobial coverage for the infection. Other clinical causes of these parameters should be considered.
E. Alternatively, if signs and symptoms of vancomycin toxicity are evident, such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, ototoxicity, or nephrotoxicity, an alternative antimicrobial should be considered. Other reported adverse effects such as myalgias, “red man's” syndrome, hypotension, and thrombophlebitis can generally be avoided by administering vancomycin through a central venous catheter over ≥60 minutes depending on the dose.
F. If multiple VSDLs are obtained and a pharmacokinetic evaluation is desired, consider consulting a clinical pharmacy specialist. Many patients may not require more than one VSDL depending on the duration of therapy. Short-term therapy is not likely to require VSDL monitoring unless renal function is impaired. Patients with fluctuating renal function or an unstable clinical course may require more frequent VSDL monitoring. Patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), hemodialysis, or other renal alteration therapies should be evaluated individually.
G. Dosage adjustments can be made by changing dose, frequency of administration, or both. Increasing the dose can increase peak concentrations and increase the time the concentration is above a desired trough level. Increasing the frequency of administration can have less of an effect on peak levels (at steady state) and can increase trough levels. The method of increasing dose frequency is generally more appropriate with vancomycin because it exhibits time-dependent killing rather than concentration-dependent killing.
H. Evaluation of a patient's VSDL should include clinical status, culture results, and the predicted penetration of the drug to the site of infection. The trough VSDL range for the majority of infections is traditionally reported as 5-15 µg/ml. Recently, clinical practice trends have used a trough VSDL target of 15–20 µg/ml for infections at sites with relatively poor vancomycin penetration such as the lungs and bones. Peak VSDL targets once aimed for 30-40 µg/ml; however, these ranges were empiric and there are limited data in the literature to support this practice.
I. Continuous infusions of vancomycin can maintain a relatively constant level of drug in the blood, which is theoretically advantageous with an agent that exhibits time-dependent killing. Lung, cerebrospinal fluid, and bone tend to be poorly penetrated by vancomycin, and levels achieved will be considerably less than the reported VSDL. If the site of infection is a difficult-to-penetrate tissue, random VSDLs should target the upper end of the desired range. Although SDLs can be relatively constant over a 24-hour period, the exposure to the drug is normally less than that of intermittent dosing regimens.
