A psychotic episode is typified by deranged thinking, speech, and behavior, often manifesting as hallucinations (false sensory impressions: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile), delusions (false fixed beliefs), difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy, disorganized thinking, and strange and inappropriate behavior.
A. When confronted with a patient who is acutely psychotic, the first task is to ensure the safety of the patient and others against injury or possible death. A calm, low-stimulus environment with nonthreatening behavior by staff is essential. Physical force should not be threatened unless overwhelming force is available. The patient should not be left alone, and an examining physician should be accompanied by at least one other person. Some patients may need to be restrained chemically and/or physically. Patients should be questioned about any thoughts of suicide or injuring others, which must be taken extremely seriously, especially if the hallucinations are auditory and are of a command type.
B. A medical history is essential in the evaluation of a patient who is psychotic. Given the patient's mental status, the most valuable information will probably come from others who know him or her. Inquire about the time course of the emerging bizarre behavior and possible relation to any preexisting or acute medical conditions, recent-onset physical symptoms, exposure to infectious or toxic agents, medication use, drug abuse, recent surgery, or physical or psychological trauma.
C. Possible medical causes of acute psychotic behavior should be considered and ruled out immediately. Despite the difficulties, perform as complete a physical examination as possible, including pupils and, to the extent possible, fundi. Examine carefully the patient's entire body for evidence of trauma, substance abuse, or any other medical condition. Staring or stereotypic motor behavior may suggest a drug-induced or seizure-related state, and obtaining an electroencephalogram may be advisable.
D. Address such readily treatable (and potentially hazardous) conditions as hypoglycemia by such means as immediate drawing of blood followed by IV injection of a concentrated dextrose solution.
E. If the history (usually from others), a careful physical examination, and indicated laboratory tests fail to reveal any organic causes of psychosis, consider a psychiatric differential diagnosis.
