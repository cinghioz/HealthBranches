Most people who are suicidal communicate their self-destructive intentions to those around them, including their physicians. As many as two thirds of those who commit suicide have seen a doctor in the weeks to months before their death. Medical students and primary care physicians should therefore know how to evaluate the patient who is suicidal. Does a patient look or feel depressed and talk of "not being able to go on,” giving up, and losing interest in activities? If so, a more detailed assessment of suicidal risk is in order. Factors to consider in a comprehensive suicide risk assessment include age, gender, social and cultural issues, psychiatric diagnosis, prevention strategies, treatment setting, and type of treatment.
A. Psychiatric disorders associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempt include depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or drug abuse, panic attacks, and panic disorders. Factors associated with high acute suicide risk in patients with affective disorders include an agitated state and severe manifestations of anxiety, panic attacks, global insomnia, and anhedonia.
B. The following psychosocial factors place people at an increased risk of committing suicide: single, divorced, widowed, or separated marital status; unemployment; decreased social supports; humiliating life events (e.g., the recent loss of a job or an important relationship); a chronic medical illness; or a family history of suicide. A previous suicide attempt is a predictor of future completed suicide.
C. Do not ignore or minimize references to suicide, such as taking risks, talking of guilt over past events, talking of "ending it all,” making a will, or giving away prized possessions. Ask patients directly whether they are suicidal and if so what plan they have; assess their understanding of the lethality of the plan. Do they have the means to carry out the plan? Have there been earlier attempts? Determine patients' mood, changes in appetite and sleep, the presence of hallucinations or delusions, and quality of speech. Patients with "command" hallucinations to commit suicide are at particularly high risk. A physical examination and laboratory studies to consider contributory or concomitant physical illness are necessary.
D. If the patient has serious immediate suicidal intent, consider psychiatric consultation and voluntary or involuntary hospitalization. If the risk is not as imminent, establish and make available a therapeutic relationship. Forming a no-suicide contract, scheduling frequent appointments, and providing reassurance and hope for the future are important. Allow the patient to ventilate feelings and help him or her problem solve, communicating empathy and caring. Treat any underlying psychiatric or medical disorder.
