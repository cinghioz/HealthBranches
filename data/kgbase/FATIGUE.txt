Acute (<6 months' duration) and chronic (>6 months' duration) fatigue are associated with many diseases, but most patients have signs and symptoms of the primary disease process. In a large urban internal medicine practice, 25% of patients admitted to at least 1 month of fatigue that interfered with their daily activities and 11%-12% of patients in two other series had chronic fatigue. Fatigue is the chief complaint in 1%-7% of office visits by adults. Acute fatigue is more likely than chronic fatigue to be associated with a clear-cut cause or to resolve spontaneously.
A. Although 75% of patients with a chief complaint of chronic fatigue have a psychiatric diagnosis and 20% have no definable diagnosis, about 7% have significant physical disease (4% have both medical and psychiatric disease, and 3% have only a medical diagnosis). Because fatigue is so nonspecific, a careful history and physical are essential and should include a description of the fatigue (e.g., is it exhaustion, breathlessness, lack of interest?), precipitating and palliative factors (is it related to work, less on vacations or weekends, affected by bed rest, onset, relationship to activities?), and any associated physical or psychological symptoms.
B. Physiologic fatigue results from a situation that would cause most people to become fatigued. It is common in sleep-deprived new parents, working mothers of toddlers, and workers doing rotating shifts or overtime, but it also can result from overtraining in athletes, malnutrition, and exposure to high noise levels. Rest, improved scheduling, and/or ear protection usually resolve the fatigue. Boring, low-paying jobs are more likely to be experienced as fatiguing than are more stimulating jobs, especially if they involve low levels of physical activity (perhaps they fall below the level needed to maintain arousal).
C. Consider drugs or toxins (alcohol, illicit drugs, sedating medications such as antihistamines, beta blockers, or nonsteroidals, including over-the-counter and herbal medications, and occupational toxin exposures). Neurologic disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, postpolio, seizures), and medical disease can cause fatigue. Adrenal insufficiency may present as fatigue but usually is associated with orthostatic hypotension. Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, asthma, sarcoidosis, anemia, lupus, hepatitis, chronic infections, and malignancy have all been identified in case series. Many illnesses produce severe fatigue, but usually other symptoms are more prominent (e.g., heart failure, tuberculosis).
D. Unless another cause of the fatigue is obvious on initial evaluation, carefully question all patients with fatigue for risk factors for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C, all of which can present as isolated fatigue.
E. Lyme disease occurs in temperate wooded climates. Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a fungus endemic in the desert southwest and can be acquired with brief exposure, such as driving through the area. Both illnesses may present as isolated fatigue.
F. Fibromyalgia affects about 3% of adult women in the general population and is characterized by aching muscles both above and below the waist, multiple tender points, and the absence of other disease to explain the symptoms. Although the American Rheumatologic Association criteria require 11 tender points of 18 tested, population studies show a spectrum of symptoms with aching muscles and increasing numbers of tender points being correlated with sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression. Up to 70% of patients who meet criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (Figure 1) also meet criteria for fibromyalgia. Because other rheumatologic conditions may cause similar symptoms, add a careful joint and skin examination as well as screening rheumatologic laboratory testing (creatine phosphokinase [CPK], C-reactive protein [CRP], ANA, and rheumatoid factor [RF]) to the usual laboratory evaluation of fatigue when fibromyalgia is suspected.
G. Because most patients with a presenting symptom of fatigue have a psychiatric diagnosis, perform a careful psychosocial assessment (Table 1). Because few of these patients think that their symptoms are psychiatric
