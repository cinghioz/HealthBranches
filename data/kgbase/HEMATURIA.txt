A. Microscopic hematuria is defined as â‰¥3 RBCs per high-power microscopic field (hpf) in two of three properly collected centrifuged urine specimens. Urine examined should be from freshly voided, clean-catch, midstream collections. Dipstick testing for heme may be positive in the presence of hemoglobin from as few as 1 RBC/hpf or in the presence of myoglobin or free hemoglobin. Any heme- positive dipstick test should be confirmed by microscopic examination.
B. Renal function tests and a CBC with prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) should be obtained. If dipstick testing is positive for either bacteruria or pyuria, a urine culture should be sent. If an infection is confirmed, dipstick testing to document resolution of hematuria can be repeated at the completion of antibiotic therapy. If dipstick testing is positive for protein, total urinary protein excretion should be measured. The ratio of the urinary protein concentration to urinary creatinine concentration (PCR) of a random urine sample provides an estimate of daily protein excretion. This should be confirmed with a 24-hour urine collection. A ratio of urinary protein to urinary creatinine >0.3 and/or a 24-hour urinary protein excretion >300 mg suggests the kidney as the source of the microscopic hematuria. The presence of dysmorphic red cells or red cell casts on microscopic examination and/or abnormal renal function further support the diagnosis of a renal parenchymal process.
C. Microscopic analysis of the urine can further distinguish glomerular from nonglomerular bleeding (Table 1). Red cell casts are a specific but insensitive marker of glomerular bleeding. Small, dysmorphic red cells also suggest a glomerular source of microscopic hematuria. Urinary red cells with a uniform biconcave disk shape suggest bleeding from a nonglomerular source.
D. Microscopic hematuria of glomerular origin without proteinuria or renal insufficiency may not require renal biopsy. The most common glomerular causes of isolated microscopic hematuria are immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease, and hereditary nephritis (Alport's syndrome). If renal function is within the normal range and stable, a renal biopsy may not be necessary for the management of isolated microscopic hematuria of glomerular origin.
E. Microscopic hematuria of glomerular origin with renal insufficiency or proteinuria warrants referral to a nephrologist for evaluation and possible renal biopsy. Serologic tests should be obtained; these include ANA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anglomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM), plasma complement (C3 and C4) levels, cryoglobulin, and hepatitis B and C.
F. Once a glomerular source of microscopic hematuria has been ruled out, a rigorous examination of the upper and lower urinary tract for the source of bleeding is warranted. Urothelial cancers are the most common malignancies in patients with isolated microscopic hematuria. Risk factors for cancer that should be borne in mind include age >40 years, a smoking history, occupational exposure to chemical and dyes (e.g., benzene or aromatic amines), history of analgesic abuse, exposure to pelvic radiation, and history of gross hematuria. CT with and without IV contrast should be considered in all patients with nonglomerular hematuria.
