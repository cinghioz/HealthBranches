CLASSICAL HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA


Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) typically presents with progressive, nontender, rubbery lymphadenopathy in supraclavicular,
cervical, axillary, or (rarely) inguinal regions. Most commonly,
patients are 15–35 years of age. Mediastinal adenopathy may
be detected incidentally or may lead to symptoms of nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, or both.
A. The diagnosis usually is made on excisional lymph
node biopsy; extranodal sites may be confirmatory. The
pathology should be reviewed by an expert hematopathologist to rule out benign causes or non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.
B. The following baseline studies are performed in all
patients to assess clinical stage: (1) CBC, including
lymphocyte count; (2) ESR and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); (3) liver enzymes, including albumin;
(4) serum alkaline phosphatase; (5) renal function
tests; (6) chest radiograph (Fig. 1); (7) CT scan of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and (8) bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy may be omitted in stage
IA/IIA patients without cytopenias. Positron emission
tomography (PET) scanning is now routinely used in
HL staging and is becoming a component in treatment assessment. Anthracycline-containing therapy

requires a baseline assessment of cardiac function,
and bleomycin-containing therapy requires a baseline
pulmonary function test.
Cotswolds modification of Ann Arbor staging system is
used.
The risk factors for limited stage (I and II) HL are:
(1) bulky disease (designated “X”) defined as any
mass !10 cm in transverse dimension or mediastinal
mass of more than one third of intrathoracic diameter or !35% of thoracic diameter at T5-6; (2) B
symptoms (defined as fever higher than 38o C,
drenching night sweats, or unexplained weight loss
of !10% over 6 months); (3) ESR "50 without B
symptoms or "30 with B symptoms; and (4) more
than three involved lymph node sites. Some groups
also consider age "50 years and extranodal extension
as risk factors.
Patients without risk factors can be considered for two
to four cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin,
vinblastine, and dacarbazine) followed by 20–30 Gy
of involved field radiation therapy (IFRT). Patients
with any risk factors may receive four cycles of ABVD
followed by 30–36 Gy of IFRT. Another option in
selected patients with limited-stage HL is ABVD
alone for four to six cycles.
The risk factors for advanced stage HL (IIXB, III, and
IV) are enumerated in the International Prognostic
Score (IPS) and include the following: (1) albumin
#4 g/dl, (2) hemoglobin #10.5 g/dl, (3) male gender,
(4) stage IV disease, (5) age "45 years, (6) WBC count
"15,000/mm3, and (7) lymphocyte count of #600/mm3
or #8% of WBC.
Six cycles of ABVD remains the standard combination
chemotherapy for advanced stage HL. Prospective
studies comparing ABVD with new regimens, Stanford V and BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone,
and procarbazine), are ongoing. In IPS 0–3 and bulky
stage II disease, IFRT is administered after satisfactory ABVD response (30–36 Gy). Another option for
patients at the IPS 0–3 advanced stage is the 12-week
regimen of Stanford V (vinblastine, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, mechlorethamine, etoposide, and
prednisone) followed by IFRT for initial sites !5 cm.
Patients ages $60 years with IPS of 4–7 may be considered for escalated BEACOPP followed by IFRT to
initial sites !5 cm.
Patients with relapsed or refractory HL should be
evaluated for salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
