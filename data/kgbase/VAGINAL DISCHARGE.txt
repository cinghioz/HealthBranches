A. Vulvovaginitis is the most common complaint necessitating a gynecologic examination. It commonly is defined as inflammation of the vulva and vagina. The diagnosis is often evident from the history. Upon initial evaluation, obtain a thorough history of previous episodes; possible sexual exposure; odor, color, and consistency of the discharge; and whether the discharge is causing itching. Pay particular attention to factors that can change vaginal flora, thus leading to vaginitis (recent use of antibiotic, oral contraceptives, or spermicides; douching). Also consider systemic conditions (poorly controlled diabetes, menopause, AIDS).
B. The cause of the vaginitis often can be determined at the time of speculum examination. Prepare two wet mounts using 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and normal saline and view them under low and high power. Appearance of the discharge often can be helpful in diagnosis: bacterial vaginosis (BV) gives a gray-white appearance; Trichomonas vaginalis, a profuse, watery, white green or yellow appearance; and Candida, a white cheesy discharge. Determining the pH of the vaginal discharge using pH indicator paper can be most useful. Normal physiologic discharge and yeast usually are <4.5; >5.0 may indicate Trichomonas or bacterial vaginosis.
C. If wet mount is nondiagnostic, consider allergic reaction to chemical or physical irritants. These possibilities are numerous and include tight clothing, deodorants, laundry detergent, soaps, tampons, and spermicides. Obtain culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in sexually active patients, and base treatment on subsequent results. Viral causes of vulvovaginitis include human papillomavirus (HPV)and herpes simplex virus (HSV). These often are diagnosed by appearance but can be confirmed by biopsy and culture. Aphthous ulcers can also occur on the vulva with an appearance similar to HSV.
D. The appearance of the unicellular protozoan T. vaginalis is diagnostic. Culture is not necessary for confirmation. The appearance under high power is of mobile flagellated organisms slightly larger than a white blood cell. The smear also may have many inflammatory cells and vaginal epithelial cells.
E. A thin gray-white discharge with an unpleasant odor (“musty” or “fishy”) often is caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, a gram-variable coccobacillus. The normal saline wet mount often shows “clue cells”: stippled epithelial cells (Gardnerella organisms adhered to the epithelial cells).
F. Significant vulvar pruritus is the usual presenting symptom of vaginal yeast infections. The appearance of filamentous forms (pseudohyphae, which are thin, greenish, segmented, and branched) and blastospores on KOH wet mount can confirm clinical suspicion.
G. Recurrent yeast infection can be frustrating for both practitioner and patient. Obtain culture of the discharge on Sabouraud's or Nickerson's medium to confirm the cause as yeast. Evaluate for other complicating factors, including evidence of diabetes, immunodeficiency (AIDS), or reinfection from partner (10%-15% of male sexual partners of women with yeast infections have had positive oral, rectal, and seminal cultures).
