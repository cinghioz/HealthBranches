Acute urinary retention (AUR) is urinary retention that develops in a rapid manner. Among urologic emergencies, AUR is the most commonly encountered. The most frequent etiology is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and the typical patient is >60 years. The typical clinical course of BPH is progression over time. In men >70 years, approximately 1 in 10 will develop AUR over a 5-year period. Increased life expectancy among men has resulted in a similarly increased incidence of BPH and related disorders. As a consequence, it is important for medical professionals to become familiar with the risk factors/etiology associated with and the initial management of AUR. Risk factors, acute management, and medical and surgical therapy will be reviewed. Most commonly, retention of urine develops secondary to an obstructive process. Obstructive pathology includes BPH, malignancy, urethral stricture, urolithiasis, phimosis, and paraphimosis. However, the use of medications, trauma, neurologic disease, infection, and (infrequently) psychological pathology can be the source of urinary retention. A great deal of research has focused on the identification of risk factors associated with the development of urinary retention. The following factors are considered the most well established. • Age: Age >70 years carries a relative risk (RR) of 7.8 for the development of urinary retention. • Symptom score: The American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score is a method used to quantify one's symptoms. This questionnaire is easy to complete and considers seven components (frequency, urgency, nocturia, weak stream, intermittency of stream, straining to void, and incomplete emptying). Each component is scored from 0 to 5 (5 being the most severe). A maximum score of 35 can be obtained. A score of 7 represents an RR of 3.2 for the development of urinary retention. Repeated administrations of this survey can be used to follow progression over time. • Prostate volume: Prostatic volumes >30 ml as measured by transrectal ultrasound have been associated with an RR of 3.0. • Urinary flow rate: Urinary flow rate of <12 ml/sec carries an RR of 3.9. A. AUR commonly presents with the inability to pass urine and lower abdominal/suprapubic discomfort. Patients can present with notable distress. Conversely, chronic urinary retention can develop over a substantial period of time with progressive obstruction or bladder dysfunction. These patients are often less severely affected and are often without discomfort. Patients with urinary retention often will present to the emergency department or to the office of a primary physician. Patients are unlikely to present initially to a urologist, so it is imperative for health care professionals to be familiar with the initial management. The initial evaluation should focus on relevant medical and surgical history with particular attention to a history of prior episodes of retention, prior urologic surgery, prior radiation, or trauma. Additional relevant information includes hematuria, dysuria, fever, back pain, and a list of medications. The physical examination should focus on the following elements: • Abdominal palpation: Palpation of the lower abdomen can reveal a palpable bladder and often can provoke great discomfort. • Rectal examination: Rectal masses, impaction of stool, and perineal sensation/reflexes should be evaluated. Examination of the prostate gland to evaluate for malignancy or prostatitis should be performed. However, a prostate with a normal consistency and size does not rule out obstructive pathology. • Pelvic examination: Urinary retention in females can be a sign of pelvic malignancy or severe pelvic floor weakness. • Laboratory evaluation: Urine should be sent for routine urinalysis and culture (usually after catheter placement). Additionally, studies should be performed according to the clinical scenario. B. The initial management of AUR involves prompt bladder decompression. This can be accomplished with urethral or suprapubic catheterization. Although there are no uniform guidelines for bladder decompression, most urologists prefer urethral catheterization for the initial management of AUR. Because patients with AUR more often present to a medical office or emergency department than to a urology office, clinician comfort with urethral catheterization is likely to greatly exceed suprapubic (SP) catheterization. Placement of an SP catheter is sometimes necessary in patients with urethral stricture disease, severe BPH, or other anatomic abnormalities that preclude Foley catheter placement per urethra. SP catheters are usually placed by an urologist, but they may be placed by others on an emergency basis. Ultrasound guidance may be indicated when adhesions are possible from prior abdominal surgery. We prefer SP catheters in patients, especially females, who are expected to require long-term bladder drainage. SP catheters prevent bladder neck and urethral dilation and therefore prevent urinary incontinence resulting from sphincter dysfunction. Furthermore, SP catheters for men avoid the risk of subsequent urethral stricture, a common complication in men requiring long-term urethral catheterization.
