PERSISTENT EXCESSIVE SWEATING


A. Several dermatologic conditions are associated with
localized hyperhidrosis: increased sweating in areas of
vitiligo, granulosis, rubra nasi, dyshidrotic eczema,
pachydermoperiostosis, epidermolysis, bullosa, pachyonychia congenita, nail-patella syndrome, palmoplantar keratodermas, and others. These conditions should
be detectable on physical examination.
B. Anxiety or stimulants may increase sweating, but some
people have severe hyperhidrosis without an obvious
precipitating event. Such patients often have a family
history of hyperhidrosis. Severe hyperhidrosis may
cause difficulty with hand work, infection caused by
the moist environment (especially in the feet), and
considerable social distress. Topical treatments have
varying success. Treatment with botulinum toxin A,
iontophoresis, sympathectomy, or removal of the
axillary sweat glands gives good results in severe cases
(see references).
C. A structural lesion in the sympathetic nervous system
may cause abnormalities in sweating. Cerebrocortical
tumors, stroke, or infection may cause contralateral
hyperhidrosis through release of inhibition. When injured sympathetic nerves regrow, connections may
develop between the parasympathetic and sympathetic
nerves. This can result in sweating of the innervated
skin, as seen with gustatory sweating. Spinal cord disease (including syringomyelia, spinal cord injury, tabes
dorsalis) may cause segmental areas of hyperhidrosis.
Thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk injury may also
cause localized hyperhidrosis. A large area of anhidrosis, as in severe diabetic autonomic neuropathy or after
a sympathectomy involving more than one limb, may
result in compensatory hyperhidrosis of other areas.
D. Many chemicals may cause sweating, either during
withdrawal states (as from alcohol or opiates) or with
use (e.g., alcohol, antidepressants, some antipsychotics,

24

“triptans,” theophylline, sildenafil, opiates, cholinergic
and adrenergic agents, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,
and others). Chronic ingestion of mercury or arsenic
can cause excessive sweating.
E. Malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, brucellosis, abdominal abscesses, rheumatic fever, and endocarditis are commonly seen with fevers and sweats as the predominant
symptoms, but any infection producing a fever may
cause sweating through the hypothalamic temperature
regulatory centers as the fever falls. Even after a severe
febrile illness resolves, patients may continue to have
sweats for days to months.
F. Certain malignant conditions, including lymphoma,
monocytic leukemia, and renal carcinoma, classically
cause fevers, but fever with associated sweats also may
be found in other malignancies. Carcinoid syndrome
may cause excessive sweating. Rheumatologic diseases
associated with excessive sweating include rheumatoid
arthritis and Raynaud’s phenomenon.
G. Other endocrine causes of hyperhidrosis include
menopause, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, gout, obesity, porphyria, rickets, and hyperpituitarism. In
some cases of hypoglycemia, CNS dysfunction and
sweat may occur in the absence of other adrenergic
symptoms.
