ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODY TEST

An ANA test is positive when a patient’s serum recognizes
components of the nucleus of a substrate cell. If the test is
positive, a dilution ratio is given (e.g., 1:160 means the sample was diluted 160 times and was still positive). An ANA is
most useful when ordered in a patient in whom autoimmune
disease is strongly suspected. This test is often used to support a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
A. Several features on history may make one suspect a
diagnosis of SLE. A history positive for fever, fatigue,
hair loss, rash, photosensitivity, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oral ulcers, chest pain, shortness of breath, hematuria, arthritis or arthralgias, seizures, or mental status
changes can be suggestive. None of these symptoms in
isolation, however, is specific for SLE or any other
rheumatic disease and could be caused by infectious or
lymphoproliferative disorders.
B. A complete physical examination should be performed.
Findings of rash, especially malar or discoid rash; oral
ulcers; a pericardial friction rub; a pleural rub or effusion; or arthritis can be suggestive. If a pleural or pericardial effusion is suspected, further imaging, such as chest
x-ray and echocardiogram is warranted. As with the historical features, none of these physical examination signs
in isolation are specific for SLE or any rheumatic disease
and could be caused by other diseases, including infectious or lymphoproliferative disorders.
C. If the history and physical examination are suggestive
of SLE, further laboratory evaluation should be
performed. A CBC, blood chemistries, liver function
tests, and urinalysis with sediment should be ordered.
Infection should be ruled out. In a patient who has a
history and physical examination suggestive of SLE, an
ANA can be a useful part of the evaluation.
D. A positive ANA is associated with many autoimmune
diseases and some chronic infections and lymphoproliferative diseases. The estimated sensitivity and
specificity of the ANA test for SLE are 100% and 86%,
respectively. For other rheumatic diseases, it is 42%
and 85%, respectively. The positive predictive value of
the ANA is low—11% for SLE and 11% for other
rheumatic diseases.

ANAs are also positive in the normal population,
especially at low titers. Of healthy people, 32% have an
ANA at 1:40, 13% at 1:80, and 3% present at !1:320.
A higher titer (!1:640) is more suggestive of disease
association.
If the ANA is determined by immunofluorescence,
patterns of nuclear staining can be determined. These
patterns are operator-dependent and have a low
sensitivity and specificity, so they have largely been
supplanted by specific tests. An anticentromere pattern should raise suspicion for scleroderma.
If an ANA is positive and the patient has symptoms
suggestive of a systemic autoimmune disease,
further specific antibody tests can be ordered. In
addition, C3 and C4 levels are often low during an
active lupus flare. ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP)
are often high.
• Anti-dsDNA (double-stranded DNA)—specific
for SLE, associated with disease activity and lupus nephritis.
• Anti-Sm (anti-Smith)—specific for SLE.
• Anti-RNP (anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein)—
necessary for the diagnosis of mixed connective
tissue disease, also associated with SLE, correlates.
• Anti-Ro (SSA)—associated with SLE and
Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Anti-La (SSB)—associated with SLE and
Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Antihistone—associated with SLE with a high
specificity for drug-induced lupus.
• Anti-Scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase I)—associated
with scleroderma.
