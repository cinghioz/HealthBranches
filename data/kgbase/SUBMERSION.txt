Drowning is death from suffocation as a result of submersion in a fluid, whereas near-drowning implies survival, at least temporarily, after such suffocation. In the United States, drowning accounts for approximately 5000 deaths, >10,000 hospital admissions, and > 30,000 emergency department (ED) visits per year. Drowning is typically in the top-five causes of traumatic death for all age groups and is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents. The backyard swimming pool is the most common cause of drowning for those < 5 years, and the bathtub is the most common household cause of drowning.
Submersion is usually accompanied by panic and breath holding. After a short period, patients will develop severe air hunger and some degree of hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in an involuntary gasp causing aspiration. This is usually followed by laryngospasm, more aspiration, and death. Of victims, 10%-15% succumb to asphyxia while submerged without evidence of aspiration, probably because of laryngospasm.
Morbidity and mortality are multifactorial and a consequence of the duration of submersion, the temperature of the water, the age and comorbidities of the victim, and the salinity and contamination of the water. Patients who are awake and conscious or have minimal alteration of consciousness on arrival have very good outcomes. The degree of neurologic impairment at presentation directly correlates to outcome.
A. Some victims of near-drowning do not aspirate water, have limited laryngospasm or breath holding, and regain effective ventilation before permanent damage occurs. These patients may appear sleepy or groggy or completely alert. Despite appearing stable, these patients may be severely hypoxic or become so quickly. Cervical spine (C-spine) precautions should be continued if neck injury is possible, and these patients should be transported with supplemental O2 to the nearest ED.
