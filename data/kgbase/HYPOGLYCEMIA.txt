A. Hypoglycemia is possibly the most common metabolic emergency because insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a common side effect of treatment of a common disease. Symptoms of hypoglycemia are partly sympathetic and related to the release of catecholamines. These symptoms develop as the plasma glucose falls below 55 mg/dl and include sweating, tremor, hunger, anxiety, fear, and palpitations. Other symptoms are caused by an insufficient supply of glucose to the brain, resulting in neuro-glycopenia with symptoms such as slurred speech, blurred vision, weakness, and confusion. Neuro-glycopenic symptoms, in general, occur when plasma glucose falls below 50 mg/dl. Symptoms should disappear with treatment. Treatment of mild episodes of hypoglycemia is intake of fast-absorbing carbohydrates. Severe episodes can be treated with either IV dextrose or glucagon injected intramuscularly or intravenously. The glycemic response and recovery of a normal level of consciousness is 1-2 minutes slower after glucagon than after glucose.
B. Patients receiving treatment for diabetes mellitus experience hypoglycemia when there is a mismatch between insulin levels (either exogenous insulin or as induced by sulfonylureas) and metabolic demands. Patients with hypoglycemia should have their records examined and insulin dosing and timing adjusted to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia without compromising overall glucose control. As targets for glycemic control have progressively declined, the incidence of hypoglycemia has increased. Patients with poor glucose control become symptomatic with adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia at progressively higher glucose thresholds, often when the plasma glucose is >100 mg/dl. When a sulfonylurea is implicated, its use should be reevaluated within the context of the patient's needs and alternative or shorter-acting agents should be considered. Because sulfonylureas have an extended half-life, patients with a sulfonylurea-induced symptomatic hypoglycemic event should not be discharged from the hospital until at least 24 hours have passed.
C. Ethanol is another common cause of hypoglycemia. In a nondiabetic person who has had an insufficient intake of food for 1 or 2 days, hypoglycemia will typically develop 6-24 hours after a moderate or heavy intake of ethanol. Drugs that are reported to induce hypoglycemia include salicylates in large doses, quinine, haloperidol, pentamidine, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
D. Patients with hypoglycemic symptoms who are not known to have diabetes should be provided with a home glucometer and instructed in its use so that glucose measures can be taken at the time when symptoms are experienced. If hypoglycemia is confirmed by review of the glucometer data or clinical suspicion is high, a prolonged supervised fast is the most reliable test for establishing the diagnosis. Symptoms that occur in the presence of a normal glucose level eliminate the need for further evaluation for hypoglycemia. A supervised fast is performed to confirm that the symptoms result from hypoglycemia and that reversing it relieves the symptoms. The fast begins at the time of last food ingestion, which can be the evening meal on the previous day. Patients are provided with calorie-free and caffeine-free drinks and should remain active. Blood samples for plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin are drawn every 6 hours; these assays are not performed unless the glucose is <60 mg/dl. The testing frequency increases to hourly if any of these glucose levels drop below 60 mg/dl. The fast is ended when the plasma glucose drops below 45 mg/dl, if the patient has symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia, or when 72 hours have elapsed. Blood is drawn to test for the presence of sulfonylureas, IV glucose is given, and the patient is fed.
E. Insulin levels >6 Î¼U/ml when the plasma glucose is <55 mg/dl are considered inappropriate insulin levels. Plasma C-peptide and proinsulin levels help distinguish exogenous from endogenous insulin sources: C-peptide and proinsulin levels should correlate with the insulin level when the insulin source is endogenous. Endogenous hyperinsulinemia can result from treatment with sulfonylureas; these can be detected in the plasma. Long-acting sulfonylureas are particularly high risk when prescribed to older patients.
F. Insulin-producing tumors, insulinomas, and non-islet cell tumors may be underlying causes of hypoglycemia in people without diabetes. When suggested by the results of a fast, insulinoma should be further investigated in consultation with an endocrinologist or endocrine surgeon. Endoscopic ultrasound is recommended for tumor identification. Intraoperative ultrasound or a selective arterial calcium-infusion test may be required to identify the source because these tumors are often extremely small.
G. Fasting hypoglycemia that is not associated with hyperinsulinemia is most often found in the presence of advanced disease such as renal or liver failure or malnutrition. It may be a presentation of adrenal insufficiency. Nonpancreatic tumors may induce hypoglycemia through the paraneoplastic secretion of insulinlike growth factor-2 or its precursor.
H. Most patients with autonomic symptoms after eating do not have hypoglycemia, and normal individuals can develop glucose levels of <50 mg/dl after eating. Postprandial hypoglycemia can occur among patients who have undergone bariatric surgery and early in diabetes mellitus in which the insulin secretion becomes dys-regulated.
