RBCs are transfused to increase oxygen-carrying capacity to meet tissue demands. The clinical significance of anemia varies widely, depending on the underlying cause, the time course, and the patient's volume status and clinical condition. Thus RBC transfusion decisions can be complex, and it is inappropriate to rely solely on a hemoglobin (Hgb) trigger. Rather, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be considered on an individual case basis. The patient's clinical status needs to be assessed carefully. Signs and symptoms of anemia (e.g., fatigue, lightheadedness, pallor, tachycardia, dyspnea on exertion) should be sought.
RBC units are derived from whole blood donations, after removal of most of the plasma, which is used for the production of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelet concentrates. RBCs may also be collected by apheresis. RBCs are stored at 1°-6° C and have a maximum shelf life of 42 days. A unit of RBCs has a volume of about 250-300 ml and is expected to increase the recipient's Hgb by approximately 1 g/dl or hematocrit by 3%.
A. Because of normal physiologic compensation mechanisms (e.g., increased cardiac output, increased oxygen extraction), anemia may be surprisingly well tolerated, particularly when subacute in onset. For patients with normovolemic anemia caused by a nutritional deficiency, transfusion frequently can be avoided. Instead, the appropriate pharmacologic therapy (i.e., iron, folate, or vitamin B12) should be administered.
B. For patients with severe acute hemorrhage, initial efforts should be focused on preventing hypovolemic shock. Volume resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid solution is of greater immediate importance than restoring oxygen-carrying capacity.
C. A number of RBC transfusion guidelines have been published. In general, it has been suggested that transfusion is almost never indicated with a Hgb level >10 g/dl and is often needed for a Hgb level <6–7 g/dl. Clinical judgment is required for patients with Hgb levels between 6-7 g/dl and 10 g/dl.
D. A particularly valuable study of RBC transfusion was the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) study, published in 1999. This was a well-designed randomized controlled trial of RBC transfusion in the intensive care setting. Almost 850 patients with anemia who were in the intensive care unit were randomly assigned to either a liberal or a restrictive transfusion strategy. Patients in the liberal group were transfused for a Hgb level <10 g/dl and were maintained with Hgb concentrations of 10–12 g/dl. Patients in the restrictive group were transfused for a Hgb level <7 g/dl and were maintained at hemoglobin levels of 7–9 g/dl. The primary end point, overall 30-day mortality, was similar in the two groups. Mortality during hospitalization was significantly lower in the restrictive group. A reanalysis of the data did reveal a trend (not statistically significant) toward higher mortality among patients in the restrictive group with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.
E. Commonly used modifications to RBC products include leukoreduction, irradiation, and washing. Leukoreduction removes >99% of contaminating WBCs and helps prevent febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission. Leukoreduction has additionally been proposed to prevent transfusion-associated immunosuppression, but the data are currently unclear. Irradiation is currently the only approved means to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Washing RBCs is done to remove plasma proteins; this is indicated when the recipient has a history of severe allergic reactions that are refractory to antihistamine administration.
