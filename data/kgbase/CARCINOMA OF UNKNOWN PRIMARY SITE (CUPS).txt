Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUPS) is defined as the presence of documented metastatic cancer without an established primary tumor. It is a heterogeneous group of carcinomas; hence, there are no common genetic and phenotypic alterations. In general, CUPS follow an aggressive pathologic and clinical course with no obvious risk factors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and pathologic studies are used to characterize CUPS (Table 1).

A. The goal of the diagnostic workup is to identify either the primary site or clinical situations where potentially curative or effective therapy is available. The optimal evaluation required to identify an occult primary carcinoma includes complete history and physical examination, laboratory studies, critical pathologic review, and appropriate imaging studies (Table 2). The incidence of CUPS is 7–12 cases per 100,000 in the United States, accounting for 2.3%–4.2% of cancer in both sexes. Median age of occurrence is ~60 years, and CUPS is the seventh to eighth most frequent cancer and the fourth most common cause of mortality in the world. As a group, median survival for CUPS from diagnosis is approximately 10–12 months.
B. A routine chest x-ray (CXR) is part of the initial evaluation; however, it may be prudent to perform a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging. CT scans appear to detect 30%-35% of primary sites. The FDG-PET (2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography) scan is a useful modality, particularly for squamous cell tumors originating in the head and neck areas.
C. An adequate sample of tumor tissue is essential because pathologic examination is the single most important step in determining the primary site. IHC utilizing antibodies to cytokeratins (7 and 20) may guide in identifying certain tumor types (Table 3). Other histology specific markers may also be of diagnostic value in difficult cases (Table 4).
D. A number of predictive and prognostic factors are characterized as significant in distinguishing favorable from unfavorable groups of CUPS (Table 5). They are certain histopathologic subsets (poorly differentiated carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma), number of metastatic lesions (2), female sex, performance status, weight loss, and serum markers (alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, [LDH], CEA).
E. Disease-specific therapy is indicated for the favorable CUPS with a potential for a good treatment outcome (Table 6).
F. However, for unfavorable CUPS, treatment is based on type 3 level of evidence. Chemotherapy regimens include platinum, taxol, or gemcitabine- or irinotecan-based combinations. The availability of gene expression profiling and tissue microarrays may help identify targets for which approved therapies exists (e.g., Avastin, Erbitux, or Herceptin) and may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In general, patients with CUPS should be considered for palliative treatment options suitable for individual clinical use or investigational use on an appropriate clinical trial.
