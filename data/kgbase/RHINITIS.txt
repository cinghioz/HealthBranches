Rhinitis is described as inflammation of the nasal mucosa and is characterized by the constellation of symptoms, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching of the eyes and/or nose. The sinuses, ears, and throat may also be involved. Allergic rhinitis is by far the most common type of rhinitis. Types of rhinitis include allergic rhinitis, infectious rhinitis (viral and bacterial), and nonallergic rhinitis. Nonallergic rhinitis includes nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), vasomotor rhinitis, gustatory rhinitis (vagally mediated), hormonal rhinitis (e.g., related to pregnancy and hypothyroidism), rhinitis medicamentosa (e.g., topical decongestants; antihypertensives and oral contraceptives), anatomic rhinitis (e.g., deviated septum, choanal atresia, adenoid hypertrophy, foreign body, nasal tumor), immotile cilia syndrome (ciliary dyskinesis), granulomatous rhinitis (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis), and atrophic rhinitis (colonization with Klebsiella ozaenae).
One must also consider cerebrospinal fluid leak or nasal polyps. Nasal polyps often occur in common with allergic rhinitis, but not necessarily a causal relationship, and may not respond to medications.
A careful history and physical examination usually can determine the cause of the rhinitis. Historical clues to diagnosis include environmental exposures, occupational exposure, personal and family history of allergies, additional past medical history (hypothyroidism, pregnancy, sarcoidosis), recent sick contacts, and medication usage (>5 days of taking nasal sympathomimetics). Physical clues may include "allergic shiners” (dark circles under eyes); pale, bluish boggy turbinates; and cobblestoning in posterior pharynx (allergic rhinitis) versus erythematous turbinates (rhinitis medicamentosa, infectious, or vasomotor rhinitis).
A. Allergic rhinitis is by far the most common type of rhinitis. Estimates suggest 9%–40% of the U.S. population have some degree of allergic rhinitis. In 80% of cases, allergic rhinitis develops by age 20 years. Incidence wanes as we age, and it is much less common in the geriatric population. History of eczema and family history of atopy may help in the diagnosis. Symptoms occur in individuals who produce an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated response to particular allergens. Allergens may be one or many, seasonal or perennial. Common seasonal allergens are trees, grasses, and weeds. Common perennial allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal proteins, dander, and molds. Diagnosing occupational rhinitis can be challenging because symptoms may occur several hours after exposure. Additionally, with chronic exposure, symptoms may not improve on weekends, requiring longer periods of avoidance. With occupational rhinitis, patients typically present with concomitant occupational asthma. Physical examination may reveal allergic shiners; injected conjunctivae; clear nasal discharge; pale, bluish boggy turbinates; and cobblestoning in the posterior pharynx.
Allergen avoidance is of utmost importance. Maintaining indoor humidity to ≤50% to limit house dust mite and mold growth may be helpful. First-line treatment of allergic rhinitis is topical intranasal steroids. Additional treatment choices include oral or intranasal antihistamines as a good second choice. Intranasal cromolyn started several weeks prior to allergy season may be effective, leukotriene inhibitors alone or in conjunction with antihistamines are useful, and oral decongestants can be effective. Topical decongestants must be used sparingly because of the development of tachyphylaxis after 3-7 days of use. With prolonged use a resulting rebound nasal congestion and rhinitis medicamentosa develop. Hypertonic saline rinsing of the nares can be used for additional benefit in both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. If medical maneuvers fail, skin testing and immunotherapy remain an option. Perennial allergic rhinitis appears to be a predisposing factor for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis by causing ostial obstruction.
B. NARES accounts for 15%-20% of patients with rhinitis. It is characterized by perennial symptoms of nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, hyposmia, and sneezing. These symptoms are milder than in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, but they are still bothersome. Nasal secretions contain 25% eosinophils on smear. IgE antibodies to inhalant allergens are usually absent. Some researchers believe this is a precursor to the triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and aspirin allergy. The most useful medications have proved to be topical nasal steroids, and if polyps are present, leukotriene inhibitors have also been shown to be helpful.
C. Vasomotor rhinitis (idiopathic rhinitis) is an umbrella term for many types of nonallergic rhinitis, including gustatory and hormonal rhinitis. Patients with vasomotor rhinitis complain of chronic nasal congestion with or without persistent rhinorrhea, exacerbated by cold air, strong odors, stress, or inhaled irritants. For the most part, vasomotor rhinitis is believed to result from autonomic dysfunction in the nose where the parasympathetic system dominates, resulting in vasodilation and edema of the nasal vasculature. Idiopathic rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion. Allergy skin testing is negative. Nasal steroids are useful, and if rhinorrhea is a major factor, ipratropium can be effective.
D. Imaging (CT scan of sinuses) should be limited to those patients who have persistent symptoms or if symptoms recur. Recurrent rhinosinusitis may also indicate an underlying process such as nasal polyps, other anatomic abnormalities, ciliary dysfunction, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, or relapsing polychondritis. Last, atrophic rhinitis is a syndrome of progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa in the elderly debilitated population. Patients report a persistent foul odor that is a result of nasal mucosal colonization with Klebsiella ozaenae. These patients respond best to nasal irrigation.
E. Prolonged use of intranasal decongestants can result in rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). The restoration of normal nasal function may take up to 21 days after withdrawal of the sympathomimetics. Additionally, numerous medications can cause rhinitis, including antihypertensives such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reserpine, phentolamine, methyldopa, and beta blockers; chlorpromazine; gabapentin; penicillamine; aspirin; NSAIDs; exogenous estrogens; and oral contraceptives. The use of intranasal cocaine can cause these symptoms as well.
F. Infectious rhinitis can be caused by both viruses and bacteria (bacterial rhinitis), with the common cold being the most common cause of infectious rhinitis. Acute infectious rhinitis is often considered in conjunction with acute sinusitis. Symptoms statistically associated with culture-proven acute bacterial sinusitis include nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, facial or dental pain, and cough. The guidelines recommend that a diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is appropriate in patients who have had symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection who have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5–7 days. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae account for 50% of rhinosinusitis bacterial isolates. Moraxella catarrhalis, other streptococcal species, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria each account for a small proportion of cases. Of symptomatic patients, 30% have negative bacterial cultures, suggesting either viral or allergic disease. Because it is not possible to predict which cases of ABRS will resolve spontaneously, the use of an antimicrobial is recommended.
Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor for infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. For patients with mild disease who have not received antibiotics in the prior 4–6 weeks, initial therapy should include amoxicillin-clavulanate, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, or cefdinir. Fluoroquinolones or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with mild disease who have had recent antibiotics or for patients with moderate disease. Treatment with a macrolide after treatment failure with amoxicillin or a cephalosporin will result in a second treatment failure in about 60% of cases as a result of high rates of resistance to macrolides in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
