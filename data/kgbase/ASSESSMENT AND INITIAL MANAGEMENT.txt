Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) are a major contributor to worldwide morbidity and mortality. In the subset of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), suggestive of complete coronary obstruction, the therapeutic principles favor prompt and early recognition of this condition and rapid restoration of coronary flow to reduce the likelihood of major sequelae of STEMI, including heart failure, arrhythmias, mechanical complications (ventricular rupture, ventricular septal defect, valvular dysfunction), and death. Early identification of symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI), including chest, back, neck, or jaw pain, and activation of medical services result in the most prompt treatment of this condition. Patients with suspected MI should receive 162–325 mg of aspirin, if available, prior to arrival of emergency medical personnel or on first medical contact. Prehospital management including fibrinolysis in appropriate settings is outside the scope of this textbook.
A. At initial hospital contact, an initial brief assessment by triage personnel should be targeted to rapidly identify patients with angina or anginal equivalent possibly suggestive of MI. All patients with suspected MI should have a 12-lead ECG performed and be evaluated by an experienced physician within 10 minutes of hospital presentation. Aspirin (162–325 mg) should be given if not previously received.
B. Initial physician contact should result in a targeted history and physical examination designed to assess the likelihood of MI or an alternative diagnosis, risks associated with MI, and possible therapies. History should include presence of cardiovascular risk factors, prior MI, ACSs, and cardiovascular procedures and should focus on symptoms related to ACSs, aortic dissection, risk of bleeding, and cerebrovascular disease (both acute and chronic). Physical examination should be performed to aid in the diagnosis of MI and assessment of possible complications, including mechanical complications, right ventricular (RV) infarction, and cardiogenic shock. A focused neurologic evaluation should be performed to assess for evidence of a prior stroke before initiation of fibrinolytic therapy. Laboratory evaluation including cardiac biomarkers should be performed but should not delay the initiation of reperfusion therapy. Similarly, chest radiography should be performed but should not delay initiation of reperfusion therapy unless it is used for the suspected identification of a contraindication to reperfusion such as aortic dissection.
C. If based on the initial evaluation STEMI is excluded, appropriate measures should be initiated for evaluation and treatment of alternative diagnoses.
D. For patients with confirmed STEMI, decision making regarding reperfusion strategy should be based on time since initial symptom onset, STEMI-related risk, risk of therapeutic options, and available resources. Uncomplicated presentations with very rapid presentations have favorable prognoses regardless of treatment strategy. Risk stratification for patients with STEMI includes infarct location (anterior vs. inferior), presence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, hemodynamic compromise, or mechanical complications; the risk of complications associated with fibrinolysis; and the likely time to treatment dependent on strategy chosen. Contraindications to fibrinolysis are generally considered to include chest pain duration >12 hours, SBP >180 mm Hg, DBP >110 mm Hg, blood pressure difference between arms of >15 mm Hg, known structural CNS disease, closed head/facial trauma within 3 months, major trauma or surgery within 6 weeks, GI or genitourinary bleeding, history of bleeding or clotting problems or current use of blood thinning agents, CPR >10 minutes, pregnancy, and serious systemic disease such as advanced cancer.
