TRANSFUSION THERAPY: PLATELETS
Richard M. Kaufman, MD

Platelets (PLTs) are transfused to prevent or treat bleeding in
patients with quantitative or qualitative PLT defects. PLTs are
either prepared from a unit of whole blood (random-donor
PLT unit, RDP) or are collected by apheresis (single-donor
PLT unit, SDP). A pool of four to six RDPs provides about
the same total PLT dose as one SDP (!3 " 1011 PLTs).
A. The vast majority of PLT transfusions are given prophylactically to patients who are not bleeding and who have
thrombocytopenia. For years, a PLT count of 20,000/#l
was used as a standard PLT transfusion trigger. Later,
multiple controlled trials demonstrated that prophylactic
PLT transfusions can safely be given using a lower trigger
(e.g., 10,000/#l), leading to substantial product inventory
and cost savings. A PLT transfusion trigger higher than
10,000/#l is often used for patients with comorbidities
(fever, coagulation defects, intracranial lesions, high
white cell counts, rapid PLT consumption).
B. A published practice guideline has recommended a PLT
count of 50,000/#l for most major surgical procedures,
with counts near 100,000/#l recommended for neurosurgical or ophthalmologic procedures. PLT counts of
25,000/#l or so are generally adequate for minor procedures, such as central venous line placement.
C. PLT transfusions are indicated to treat bleeding in the
setting of thrombocytopenia or a qualitative platelet
abnormality. The goal should be to maintain a PLT
count $50,000/#l.
D. Bleeding in the setting of pharmacologic inhibitors of
PLT function (aspirin, clopidogrel, abciximab, etc.)
frequently responds to PLT transfusion. In contrast,
uremic bleeding tends to respond less well to PLT
transfusion because the infused PLTs rapidly acquire
the same defect affecting the patient’s own PLTs.
E. The response to PLT transfusion is assessed by observing
whether bleeding stops and by measuring a posttransfusion PLT count. The expected PLT increment for an
average adult receiving an SDP or a pool of RDPs is
30,000–60,000/#l. Although the posttransfusion increment is the usual value considered in routine practice, a
more accurate measure of PLT response is provided by
the corrected count increment (CCI):

250

CCI %

Body surface area (m2) " PLT count increment/#l " 1011
No. of PLTs transfused

A CCI of !7500 indicates an adequate PLT response.
F. Platelet refractoriness may be defined as a poor increment following repeated PLT transfusions. Several nonimmune factors can cause PLT refractoriness, including
medications, fever, sepsis, DIC, bleeding, splenomegaly,
and graft-versus-host disease. In a subset of cases, PLT
refractoriness is immune mediated. A 10-minute to
1-hour posttransfusion PLT count that fails to show an
adequate CCI on more than one occasion usually indicates antibody-mediated PLT destruction (alloimmunization). A recipient panel-reactive antibody (PRA) score
of !20% provides supporting evidence for the role of
anti–human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies.
G. PLTs themselves tend to be poor immunogens. For patients who become alloimmunized, the initial antigenic
stimulation generally comes from HLA class I molecules
expressed on WBCs. Providing leukoreduced blood
products is effective at helping to prevent PLT alloimmunization. Once a patient does become alloimmunized
to PLTs, a number of strategies may be considered, including administering HLA-matched or cross-matched
PLTs. If the specificity of the recipient antibody can be
determined, providing antigen-negative PLT units may
also be effective.
