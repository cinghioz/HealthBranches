A. Chest pain causes anxiety because of the possibility of cardiac disease. Coronary disease should be excluded before investigating esophageal causes of chest pain. Although microvascular angina is possible with normal coronary arteries, it is not common. More than 600,000 patients a year undergo cardiac catheterization, and one third have normal coronary arteries. Thus, >150,000 patients per year may require evaluation for noncardiac chest pain. Esophageal disorders may cause cardiac-type chest pain in up to 50% of these patients. Associated symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, or heartburn are suggestive of an esophageal source but are often absent.
B. Endoscopy is often used initially to exclude structural or mucosal abnormalities such as erosive esophagitis, esophageal strictures/tumors, achalasia, hiatal hernia, and gastric ulcers. Although the diagnostic yield is low, this can be an important test for excluding complicated esophageal disease.
C. Of patients with normal coronary arteries and cardiac chest pain, 35%-50% have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This may or may not be manifested by erosive esophagitis. Therefore, a normal endoscopic result does not exclude reflux, and reflux may cause cardiac-type chest pain without symptoms of dysphagia or heartburn. In addition, acid perfusion of the esophagus not only lowers the threshold for myocardial ischemia but may induce this condition. The most sensitive test for documenting GERD is ambulatory pH monitoring, which allows correlation of chest pain events with reflux events. Another commonly used “diagnostic” test is a 2- to 4-week therapeutic trial with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole or lansoprazole) at a high dosage. Resolution of chest pain implies that it was caused by acid (e.g., reflux); appropriate therapy can then be prescribed, although the accuracy of this test has recently been questioned. An etiologic association can be assumed if cardiac-type chest pain is temporally related to reflux. Unfortunately, pH monitoring is not widely available.
D. Motility disorders of the esophagus account for cardiac-type chest pain in 5%-38% of patients evaluated in noncardiac chest pain series. Manometry measures the pressure and function of the lower esophageal sphincter and the motility of the esophageal body. Most motility abnormalities are intermittent and may be missed during manometry. In addition, the motility abnormality rarely is accompanied by chest pain during the study. High-pressure peristaltic contractions (nutcracker esophagus) are the most common motility disorder diagnosed in patients with chest pain (up to 30%), followed by nonspecific motility disorders (20%-30%), diffuse esophageal spasm (5%-10%), and achalasia (2%-3%). Unless chest pain occurs with the observed motility disturbance, causation cannot be assumed.
E. If motility testing is nonspecific or nondiagnostic, provocative testing may be done. Provocative testing is based on the hypothesis that the esophagus is hypersensitive to normal or physiologic stimuli and that chest pain is simply an altered or heightened perception of these stimuli. Most patients with noncardiac chest pain have personality traits similar to those of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (i.e., they are anxious, depressed, hypochondriacal, and neurotic), and one third meet diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. Provocative tests include perfusing the distal esophagus with acid (Bernstein test), intravenous infusion of a cholinergic agent (Tensilar), or inflation of a balloon in the esophagus (balloon distention). Reproduction of cardiac-type pain is considered diagnostic of an esophageal source of the pain.
