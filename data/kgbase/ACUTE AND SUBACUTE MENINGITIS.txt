ACUTE AND SUBACUTE MENINGITIS

A. Prior to lumbar puncture (LP) brain imaging is recommended to rule out a mass lesion for patients with focal
neurologic deficits, abnormal level of consciousness,
papilledema, seizure in the past 7 days, or history of
CNS disease (mass, stroke, or infection) or for those
who are immunocompromised. Brain herniation after
LP remains a rare event.
B. If imaging is indicated, blood cultures should be
drawn and steroids and antibiotics should be administered before imaging to prevent delay in treatment.
Antibiotics should be administered emergently (within
30 minutes) in any patient with suspected bacterial
meningitis.
C. If CNS imaging reveals a mass lesion, neurosurgical
evaluation may be indicated. Radiologic evidence of
temporal lobe abnormalities should be treated empirically as herpes simplex encephalitis pending diagnostic
confirmation.
D. Dexamethasone administered at 0.15 mg/kg is recommended in adults with moderate to severe impairment
(Glasgow Coma Scale score !12) and suspicion of
pneumococcal disease. It should be given just prior to or
concomitant with IV antibiotic therapy; it is thought to
protect against inflammatory response to bacteria inside
the subarachnoid space. Dexamethasone should not be
administered after antibiotics have already been given.
E. Antibiotics should be administered empirically and
without delay. Antibiotic regimens can be revised once
information from the history, physical examination, and
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain is available.

F. In normal adult hosts "60 years, the most common
organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria
meningitidis, and (more rarely) Haemophilus influenzae. In patients >60 years, S. pneumoniae predominates, but Listeria monocytogenes and group B streptococcus are also seen in this age group.
G. In patients who are immunocompromised, including
patients with HIV/AIDS, cancer, end-stage renal disease, alcoholism, and diabetes, and in patients taking
high-dose steroids, additional organisms should be
considered. These include Cryptococcus neoformans,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus species,
and aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
H. Closed head trauma and basilar skull fractures are
linked to infections with S. pneumoniae and gramnegative bacilli. Neurosurgical procedures increase
risk for meningitis from Staphylococcus aureus and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus, and aerobic
gram-negative bacilli have also been implicated. Upper respiratory flora should be suspected after invasive sinus instrumentation.
I. Intraventricular shunt devices are at high risk of causing
infection. The most common organism is Staphylococcus epidermidis; other skin flora, including S. aureus,
diphtheroids, and Propionibacterium acnes are also frequent culprits.

J. The Gram stain should be used to target antimicrobial
therapy. If the organism identified is not S. pneumoniae,
dexamethasone can be discontinued. CSF cultures
should be sent to confirm the diagnosis. Blood cultures
will also be positive in 50%–75% of patients with bacterial meningitis.
K. If no bacteria are seen on Gram stain, other organisms
should be considered. Cryptococcal meningitis should
be investigated with India ink stain, cryptococcal
antigen testing, and fungal cultures. Only 75% of CSF
samples infected with Cryptococcus will have positive
India ink stains; however, serum and CSF cryptococcal
antigen detection has #95% sensitivity. The gold
standard remains fungal culture.
L. If Cryptococcus is not present, and if CSF glucose levels
are normal and CSF is without significant leukocytes,
consider a parameningeal focus.
M. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the CSF may indicate partially treated bacterial meningitis or a viral
meningitis. Empiric antimicrobials should be continued and viral studies, such as enterovirus polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), should be done on the CSF
sample.

N. In patients with predominantly monocytic white cells
in the CSF, a decreased glucose level should prompt
consideration for tuberculous meningitis. Partially
treated bacterial or fungal meningitis remains a possibility. A monocytic CSF with normal glucose is more
indicative of viral infection. PCR sent on CSF can
elucidate common viral entities that cause meningitis.
O. Tuberculous meningitis can be an elusive diagnosis.
CSF acid-fast bacilli smear is key, as is culture sent
from 10 ml of spun CSF sediment. Empiric therapy
must be considered in patients with risk factors
because culture results can take up to 6 weeks.
