Adjuvant systemic treatment refers to chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or biologic agents given with curative intent in addition to local treatment for breast cancer (i.e., surgery with or without radiation). The goal is to eliminate clinically occult micrometastatic disease that might result in disease recurrence. Systemic treatment given before definitive surgery, often done in the setting of locally advanced disease, is termed neoadjuvant therapy.

A. Decision making: The decision to use adjuvant therapy requires balancing a patient's risk of disease recurrence, expected benefits from systemic therapy, and toxicities associated with treatment. Important prognostic features include age, medical comorbidities, histologic subtype, tumor size, tumor grade, angiolymphatic invasion, number of lymph nodes involved, and hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. A validated computer-based algorithm, Adjuvant! Online (www.adjuvantonline.com), estimates a patient's 10-year risk of recurrence and mortality based on these factors (except HER2) and estimates the impact that adjuvant treatments will have. Increasingly, oncologists are incorporating information from genomic tests (e.g., Oncotype Dx) into prognostication and decision making, particularly for patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) lymph node-negative disease.
B. Chemotherapy: Overall, modern adjuvant chemotherapy reduces breast cancer mortality by approximately 50% in women <50 years and 33% in women 50â€“69 years of age. Benefits are greatest in patients with estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative tumors. In the United States, guidelines suggest consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy for tumors equal to 1 cm or any tumor with lymph node involvement. Patients' with high risk features and tumors 0.6-1.0 cm should also consider treatment. Conventional chemotherapy has significant toxicities, however, including alopecia, nausea, bone marrow suppression, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and hypersensitivity reactions. Recent evaluations using genomic testing suggest that some patients may be spared the toxicity of chemotherapy even when conventional prognostic factors suggest higher-risk disease.
C. Endocrine therapy: Adjuvant hormonal therapy benefits patients who have hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumors, including tumors that are ER+ or progesterone receptor positive (PR+), but not patients with hormone-resistant tumors. In women with HR+ disease, adjuvant tamoxifen decreases the annual odds of recurrence and death (by 39% and 31%, respectively) independent of age, menopausal status, lymph node involvement, or the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Premenopausal women with HR+ breast cancers should receive tamoxifen for at least 5 years, and ongoing studies are evaluating the risks and benefits of the addition of ovarian suppression or extended duration of tamoxifen. In recent years, several prospective randomized trials have shown increased disease-free survival and lower rates of ipsilateral, contralateral, and metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women treated with aromatase inhibitors (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane) compared to tamoxifen. Extended treatment with letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen has also been shown to further improve these results, but the optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor treatment and sequence of therapy (i.e., when and whether to include tamoxifen) is under active investigation. All endocrine therapies are associated with menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats. Tamoxifen confers an additional increased risk of uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis, whereas aromatase inhibitors are associated with vaginal dryness, musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and a higher risk of bone fracture.
D. Biologic agents: Nearly one fifth of breast cancers overexpress HER2, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, which is associated with a poor prognosis unless treated with trastuzumab, a humanized, monoclonal antibody. Two parallel trials, analyzed together, showed a dramatic reduction in disease recurrence and death (by 52% and 33%, respectively) associated with 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab following an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Other trials have tested trastuzumab in patients treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens and have confirmed significantly improved disease-free survival. Treatment with trastuzumab is associated with up to a 4.1% risk of severe cardiomyopathy, so concurrent treatment with anthracyclines should be avoided, and patients should be closely monitored for signs of cardiac dysfunction. Other novel biologic therapies, including lapatinib and bevacizumab, are currently under active investigation in women with early breast cancer.
