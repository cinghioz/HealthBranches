EDEMA


Edema is an abnormal collection of fluid in the interstitial
space that may be localized or generalized. Fluid movement between the intravascular and extravascular space is
related to the interacting forces of hydrostatic pressure,
colloid oncotic pressure, and capillary permeability and to
the effects of lymphatic drainage. Normally there exists an
equilibrium among these forces, and no net fluid accumulation takes place. Edema occurs when there is a decrease
in plasma oncotic pressure, an increase in hydrostatic pressure, an increase in capillary permeability, or a combination of these factors. Edema also can be present when
lymphatic flow is obstructed.
A. The history and physical examination focus on the
causes of edema and seek to ascertain whether it is
generalized or localized.
B. Generalized edema can be documented by weight gain
and often is associated with increased capillary hydrostatic pressure as seen in congestive heart failure
(CHF), in renal failure with increased sodium and
water load, after expansion of the intravascular volume
from IV fluids, or in conditions of sodium retention.
Edema may occur after corticosteroid therapy or with
estrogens or other medications. Edema involving the
whole body (e.g., anasarca) may extend to involve the
peritoneal cavity (e.g., ascites) or the pleural space
(e.g., hydrothorax). In patients with generalized edema
the first step is to estimate central venous pressure by
determining jugular venous pressure (JVP). The distance from the manubrium sterni to the fluid meniscus
in the jugular vein should be !2 cm at 45 degrees or
5 cm from the left atrium.
C. Determine serum albumin and urinary protein in patients with generalized edema and normal JVP.
D. If serum albumin is normal, perform urinalysis, looking
for abnormal urinary sediment, and check BUN and
creatinine to evaluate the possibility of renal pathology. If
urinalysis findings are normal, order thyroid function
tests (TFTs) to look for myxedema. Remaining patients

should be considered as possibly having idiopathic edema
or drug-induced edema.
If serum albumin is decreased, perform urinalysis to
check for proteinuria. More than 3.5 g protein suggests
nephrotic syndrome; "3.5 g in a normal urinalysis suggests another cause, such as hepatitis or hepatic infiltration disease. Order liver function tests (LFTs); if
results are abnormal, evaluate for liver pathology. If
LFT results are normal, check prealbumin and cholesterol to evaluate for malnutrition. If the prealbumin is
"20 mg/dl and the cholesterol level is low, malnutrition is suggested. If the prealbumin is #20 mg/dl, a
capillary leak, abnormal protein synthesis, and proteinlosing enteropathy are all possibilities.
In patients with an elevated JVP and generalized
edema, order chest radiographs to look for cardiomegaly.
If cardiomegaly is found, order an echocardiogram to
look for pericardial effusion; pericardial thickening, as
in acute or chronic pericarditis; abnormal contractility
of the heart, as might be seen in CHF; or signs of infiltrative cardiac problems, such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, amyloid, or neoplasm.
If cardiac size is normal on the chest film, evaluate the
lung fields for pulmonary hypertension. Such a finding
should lead to evaluation for cor pulmonale. Clear lung
fields should prompt echocardiography to seek pericardial constriction.
Regional edema or localized edema often is caused by
increased capillary pressure. Some causes include
chronic venous insufficiency; incompetent venous
valves; vascular obstructions, either extrinsic because
of neoplasm, lymph nodes, surgery, fibrosis, or radiation, or intrinsic because of deep venous thrombosis,
surgery, infection, immobility, trauma, or a hypercoagulable state (e.g., protein C deficiency, protein S
deficiency, antithrombin 3 deficiency, the presence of
neoplasms, or secondary to the venodilating effects of
drugs such as calcium channel blockers).

J. When regional edema is present, note its location. If it
is in one or both upper extremities, determine JVP.
K. Patients with upper extremity edema and normal JVP
should undergo a Doppler study, impedance plethysmography (IPG), venography, or color flow duplex
scanning to look for venous obstruction from either
intrinsic or extrinsic causes. A negative study suggests
lymphatic obstruction.
L. Evaluate patients with upper extremity edema and elevated JVP for superior vena cava syndrome with a
chest radiograph, CT scan, or MRI of the chest.
M. If the regional edema is confined to the lower extremities, note whether it is unilateral or bilateral. Seek historical features specifically directed toward trauma, a
hypercoagulable state, history of neoplasm, or conditions that might cause lymphatic or venous obstruction.
N. If the history is negative, order a Doppler study or
IPG. If this study is positive, venography may be indicated to evaluate venous thrombosis versus extrinsic
compression. If the Doppler study is negative, rhabdomyolysis, musculoskeletal edema, or localized vascular
defects may be present.

O. Patients with a positive history of lower extremity edema
should undergo IPG, Doppler study, or venography of
the lower extremity. Again, a positive study result may
suggest venous thrombosis, with treatment for this. A
negative study result may suggest lymphatic obstruction.
This can be evaluated with lymphangiography.
