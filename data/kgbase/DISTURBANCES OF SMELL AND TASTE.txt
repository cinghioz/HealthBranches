Dysfunction of smell or taste usually is not a disease entity in itself; it is usually secondary to another disease process such as sinus disease, medications, toxins, neurodegenerative conditions, tumor, or trauma. Both are insidious symptoms; the patient often does not notice loss of taste, especially when the onset is gradual. Loss of smell, however, may be noticed by the patient as a change in taste sensation. Anosmia is the absence of smell sensation; dysosmia or parosmia is a distorted smell perception, either with or without an odorant stimulus present; and hyposmia is a reduced sense of smell. Abnormalities in taste sensation are classified into ageusia (absence of taste perception), hypogeusia (diminished taste), and dysgeusia (distortion of taste resulting in a persistent metallic, bitter, sour, sweet, or salty taste).

A. Diagnostic workup of a patient with smell or taste impairment proves difficult because the complaints are subjective, thus making objective assessment challenging. Evaluation includes a thorough history (gradual or acute onset and other associated findings), physical examination (includes ear, nose, and throat and neurologic examination), and special examination of taste and smell. Head CT with particular attention to the nasal cavities, anterior cranial fossa, and nasal sinuses are important in evaluating for anatomic abnormalities. Further imaging studies, such as MRI, are indicated according to the pathophysiologic process suspected. Biopsy of the olfactory neuroepithelium can be obtained by a needle and is generally a safe procedure. Biopsy utility rests in its ability to demonstrate changes that occur in steroid-dependent anosmia, posttraumatic anosmia, posttrial olfactory dysfunction, and congenital anosmia. Medications affecting the sense of smell and taste are numerous and include opioid analgesics, flunisolide, promethazine, terbinafine, antibiotics, antifungal agents, antiinflammatory drugs, cytotoxic agents, cardiovascular drugs, antiepileptics, psychotropics, nasal decongestants, and antithyroid medications. The true incidence of drug-induced taste and smell disturbances is likely higher because of the infrequency of reporting. Drug-induced smell and taste disturbances can be minimized by avoiding the use of drugs known to induce such disturbances in patients with diseases that make them susceptible to smell and taste disorders. Good nutritional support with zinc supplementation may reduce the possibility of the onset of drug-induced smell and taste disorders. Good oral hygiene coupled with prevention of dry mouth may reduce the incidence of taste disturbances. Once a patient shows signs of such disturbance, an early discontinuation of the offending drug may prevent complete loss or irreversible distortion of smell or taste.
B. Congenital anosmia appears to be caused by absence of olfactory epithelium. The most common congenital disorder is Kallmann's syndrome, in which there is agenesis of the olfactory bulbs in combination with hypogonadism and other developmental abnormalities.
C. Tumors implicated as causes of anosmia are olfactory groove meningiomas, frontal lobe gliomas, and pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension. Another cause is a large aneurysm of the anterior cerebral or anterior communicating artery. Diseases such as chronic rhinitis and sinusitis or conditions leading to nasal obstruction are common causes of decreased smell. Anosmia caused by these conditions is frequently amenable to treatment; if untreated, it may steadily worsen.
D. Anosmia may occur after even mild head trauma, especially after a blow to the occiput, which causes shearing of the olfactory filaments as they course through the cribriform plate. Although there is no treatment for posttraumatic loss of smell, gradual recovery of smell function occurs in about one third of patients. The olfactory bulbs and their nerves can be damaged during subfrontal craniotomy or as the result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis at the base of the skull, or a frontal lobe abscess. Sudden loss of smell, and sometimes also of taste, may occur after an upper respiratory infection. This is more common in older patients and is thought to result from viral damage of the olfactory mucosa. Recovery, if it occurs at all, may take years.
E. Dysosmia is common in elderly persons with or without dementia. In Alzheimer's disease, there may be deficits in central processing of smell, rather than a primary sensory impairment. Uncinate fits, a form of temporal lobe seizures, consist of brief periods of unpleasant or foul odor perception, together with an alteration of consciousness. Gustatory hallucinations may be part of a temporal lobe seizure and manifestations of other temporal-parietal dysfunction. The diagnosis can be confirmed with EEG, and the seizures can be treated with anticonvulsant medication. Olfactory hallucinations also have been described with illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and alcohol withdrawal.
F. A unilateral loss of taste on the anterior two thirds of the tongue can be found in Bell's palsy and results from involvement of the chorda tympani. Loss of taste as a result of head injury is less common than loss of smell. It may be unilateral or bilateral, presumably caused by damage to the chorda tympani. Patients with diabetes mellitus often have a decreased sensation of sweet, bitter, and sour flavors. This is more common in patients with long-standing diabetes and in those with associated diabetic neuropathy. Cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to cause progressive loss of smell in a dose-related manner, with a gradual restoration of smell perception once patients have stopped smoking. Likewise, chronic alcoholism may lead to dysosmia and dysgeusia.
G. Oral disorders causing taste disturbances include gastroesophageal reflux, oral candidiasis, lichen planus, leukoplakia, carcinoma of the tongue, and other tongue afflictions; xerostomia and sialoadenitis; and palatal clefts and facial hypoplasia. Periodontal disease and other infectious processes may produce abnormal oral secretions, resulting in taste changes. Dental restorations or prostheses can give a metallic taste, whereas dentures may block taste reception.
