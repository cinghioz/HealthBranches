GI bleeding generally is separated into upper and lower GI bleeding, although sometimes the source actually is in the "middle" (Table 1). Severity ranges from trivial to massive and may be acute or chronic. In the United States, each year about 100 patients per 100,000 are hospitalized for upper GI bleeding and about 20 patients per 100,000 are hospitalized for lower GI bleeding. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment over the past several decades, mortality from GI bleeding remains about 5%. The outcome is adversely affected by volume of blood loss, advanced age, coexisting medical conditions, exposure to GI irritants, and other factors (Table 2).

A. Melena, or black stool, may develop with as little as 50 ml of blood loss from the GI tract per day. Although melena usually results from upper GI bleeding, it can come from a source as low as the right colon. Brisk bleeding may cause vomiting of blood (hematemesis) or appear as red blood per rectum (hematochezia). Vomiting either red blood or “coffee ground” material (which is caused by the action of gastric acid on blood) typically signifies an upper GI source but also can result from swallowed blood from the nose or respiratory tract. Red blood per rectum usually is a sign of lower GI bleeding, although it may come from profuse upper GI bleeding, such as from esophageal varices or an eroded artery in a peptic ulcer.
Some features of the history may be diagnostically helpful. Age of the patient makes some diagnoses more or less likely. For example, ischemic colitis, cancer, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis are associated with advanced age, whereas none is a probable consideration in a 25-year-old. Bleeding from inflammatory bowel disease or a Meckel's diverticulum is more likely in a child or young adult. Recent ingestion of aspirin, other NSAIDs, or alcohol predisposes to gastric mucosal injury. Aspirin also inhibits platelet adhesion, which may aggravate bleeding of any cause. Patients with liver disease are at risk to develop varices, but about half of upper GI bleeding in patients with known varices is from another source. Bleeding from an esophagogastric mucosal tear may be preceded by retching, but only about a third of patients with Mallory-Weiss disease have that traditional history; the diagnosis depends on endoscopy. Patients with aortoenteric fistula typically have massive bleeding from the mouth or rectum, which may stop abruptly; if it recurs, it may be fatal. Suspicion of an aortic aneurysm or history of an aneurysm repair is important information in patients with massive GI bleeding that stops abruptly. Endoscopy rarely identifies the fistula but is useful in ruling out other causes. Aortic aneurysm repair also places the patient at risk for ischemic colitis because of interruption of the inferior mesenteric artery in the absence of adequate collateral circulation. Nonocclusive ischemic vascular disease of the bowel occurs in older patients who have a condition that predisposes them to a transient reduction in bowel perfusion, such as congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmia. Such patients characteristically have a sudden onset of moderate lower abdominal pain with bloody stool. Usually the course is self-limited with recovery in several days. A few patients develop bowel infarction and require surgery. Irradiation that includes the gut can cause acute bleeding or bleeding months to years later; the latter is a form of ischemic colitis as a result of radiation-induced perivascular inflammation.
B. During the physical examination the patient may appear pale and feel cool because of loss of blood and poor peripheral perfusion. Acute blood loss causes cardiac output and blood pressure (BP) to decrease and pulse rate to increase. With severe volume loss, postural compensation of BP and pulse are inadequate. If pulse rate increases >20 beats/min and systolic BP decreases >10 mm Hg when the patient stands, blood loss probably exceeds 1 L. However, age, cardiovascular status, and rate of blood loss affect these postural signs. Rectal examination provides direct access to the GI tract and should always be done, even when upper GI bleeding seems obvious.
C. Initial laboratory studies should include CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphate, and blood typing. Blood gases should be monitored in patients who are severely ill. Low hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) are attributable to blood loss, but some patients bleed so rapidly that blood volume has had insufficient time to equilibrate, resulting in normal or only slightly reduced Hgb and Hct. In patients who are actively bleeding, changes in BP and pulse and direct evidence of continued bleeding via nasogastric (NG) tube or per rectum are better indicators of the need to administer electrolyte solutions or replace blood.
Determination of platelet count and clotting factors is important so that abnormalities can be corrected promptly. Extensive blood transfusion dilutes platelets and clotting factors. Also, many patients who bleed while taking therapeutic anticoagulants do so from a clinically significant lesion. Acute GI bleeding may be associated with a modest elevation of WBC count, but usually not more than 15,000/mm³, so do not attribute leukocytosis to blood loss without considering sources of infection. BUN may increase in upper GI bleeding as a result of absorption of nitrogenous products of blood in the small intestine or as a result of hypovolemia. In patients with marginal liver function, the increased protein load from blood in the gut may induce or aggravate hepatic encephalopathy; gastric lavage and control of bleeding are particularly important in the treatment of these patients.
