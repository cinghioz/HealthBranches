Urticaria is a vascular reaction of the skin characterized by evanescent edematous plaques (wheals, hives). Angio-edema differs only in that the edema extends into the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. About 15% of the population develops this problem at some time in life. In about 60% of cases the lesions resolve in <6 weeks (acute urticaria); in the remaining patients the disease persists longer, usually in the form of recurrent episodes.
A. In about 25% of cases a definite cause can be uncovered, and in most of these patients the history and physical examination alone are sufficient to determine the cause.
B. The most common cause of acute urticaria is a drug reaction. The agents often implicated are sulfonamides, penicillin derivatives, barbiturates, diuretics, and anti-inflammatory agents. Medications taken within 14 days of the onset of the urticaria are the most likely offenders. Certain foods such as nuts, shellfish, and eggs may produce urticaria in susceptible individuals. Focal infections, such as sinusitis or genitourinary infections, and systemic infections, such as viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis, occasionally produce urticaria. In rare instances, patients may develop localized wheals after direct contact with an offending agent (contact urticaria).
C. Certain chronic skin diseases have lesions that appear urticarial and must be differentiated from urticaria. Urticaria pigmentosa (mastocytosis) presents with stable brown papules that urticate when rubbed. The lesions of urticarial vasculitis are wheals that persist for several days and often have a violaceous color. These diagnoses can be confirmed by a skin biopsy.
D. Many cases of chronic urticaria are secondary to physical stimuli that produce hives in susceptible patients. Dermographism occurs in 5% of the population and consists of wheals that develop 1–3 minutes after skin stroking. Stimuli as innocuous as toweling after bathing or rubbing one's eyes can produce hives. Less commonly, patients develop wheals after cold, heat, water, or sun exposure. Patients with cholinergic urticaria develop 2- to 4-mm wheals within 2–20 minutes after general overheating of the body, such as occurs after vigorous exercise.
E. In patients with chronic urticaria that is not secondary to physical stimuli, a routine noninvasive laboratory screen is indicated. However, abnormal laboratory test results rarely uncover an occult cause of urticaria in the face of a normal history and physical examination.
F. In many patients an identifiable cause of chronic urticaria is never uncovered. In some of these there may be psychogenic influences that exacerbate the urticarial episodes. Others may have a genetic tendency that makes them more prone to hives from a variety of stimuli. Some cases of chronic urticaria are caused by an autoimmune phenomenon in which autoantibodies bind to IgE receptors on the surface of mast cells, resulting in mast cell activation and degranulation.
