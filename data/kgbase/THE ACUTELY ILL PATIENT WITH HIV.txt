A careful history and physical examination are crucial to the care of an acutely HIV-positive patient. In particular, the history should focus on localizing features of the illness, recent exposures, prior infections, severity of HIV, and medication history. Attention to localizing symptoms and exposures (including sexual and environmental exposures) help narrow the differential diagnosis and focus the workup. This chapter highlights several common presentations of acute illness in HIV-positive patients: CNS symptoms, respiratory tract symptoms, odynophagia, diarrhea, genitourinary complaints, dermatologic complaints, and systemic febrile illnesses.

In addition to focusing on localizing symptoms, the history should focus on the status of the patient's HIV disease. All patients with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count, are susceptible to community pathogens. However, the CD4 cell count is predictive of their susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. Patients with a CD4 cell count >200 and a total percentage of CD4 cells of >14% are less susceptible to opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). In contrast, patients with CD4 cell counts <50 are susceptible to a large number of opportunistic pathogens, including PCP, toxoplasmosis, Cryptococcus, JC virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Thus knowledge of the most recent CD4 count is extremely helpful in directing the workup based on the patient's risk for opportunistic pathogens.

The medication history should focus on current antiretroviral and prophylactic medications. Antiretroviral medications have been associated with a number of side effects that mimic acute infectious illnesses. Some of these side effects are specific to the class of antiretroviral medication; whereas others are specific to the particular drug. For example, protease inhibitors commonly cause diarrhea, whereas nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can infrequently cause lactic acidosis that presents as severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In contrast, abacavir and nevirapine cause severe drug-specific side effects. Abacavir infrequently causes a life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome manifesting as fever, malaise, and rash; nevirapine can cause severe hepatotoxicity.
Prophylactic medications for the prevention of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV sometimes cause severe drug reactions. For example, chronic dapsone use rarely may cause methemoglobinemia (particularly in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency) that presents with dyspnea and fatigue. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a common cause of rash and other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.

Respiratory System: The differential diagnosis for an HIV-infected patient with respiratory symptoms regardless of CD4 cell count includes bacterial pneumonia, influenza (if in season), tuberculosis (if exposure history is present), drug toxicity, and other respiratory viruses. In particular, patients with HIV are at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia compared with patients without HIV; the risk is further increased among patients with CD4 counts of <200. Workup of respiratory symptoms should include chest imaging and, if appropriate by history and risk factors, rapid testing for influenza and induced sputum for acid-fast bacillus (AFB). If the CD4 cell count is <200 and the patient is not taking adequate PCP prophylaxis, then PCP should be sought by special stains on induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Drug toxicity, including abacavir hypersensitivity, dapsone-related methemoglobinemia, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated lactic acidosis, can also present as dyspnea and tachypnea and should be considered in patients taking relevant medications. For more details see the chapter Respiratory Symptoms in HIV-Infected Patients (p. 322).

Central Nervous System: Patients with HIV infection who present with new mental status changes or other neurologic symptoms should be worked up as described in the chapter Central Nervous System Infection in the HIV-Infected Patient (p. 326). Patients with HIV presenting with a new change in vision or eye pain require rapid ophthalmologic evaluation. The differential diagnosis for ophthalmologic symptoms in patients with a low CD4 count includes CMV retinitis, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, among other diagnoses.

Dysphagia and Odynophagia: Dysphagia and odynophagia are common problems in the HIV-positive patient. The differential diagnosis, in addition to bacterial pharyngitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection, includes esophageal candidiasis, herpes simplex or CMV esophagitis, and aphthous ulcers. If oral candidiasis is present on examination, then empiric


Diarrhea. The differential diagnosis for diarrhea in the HIV-infected patient is broad and includes medication-related diarrhea and infection secondary to bacteria, viruses, or parasites. The risk for bacterial diarrhea in particular is higher among patients with HIV than among patients without HIV. This risk increases with severity of HIV disease. In a large study of HIV-infected patients with diarrhea, Clostridium difficile was the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea, followed by Shigella and Campylobacter. For patients with chronic symptoms, consider medication-related diarrhea and parasitic infection with Cryptosporidium and Giardia. In patients with CD4 cell counts <50, consider disseminated MAC infection. Workup should include stool culture for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and Vibrio; stool C. difficile toxin testing; stool examination for ova and parasites (O&P); and blood isolators for mycobacteria if the CD4 cell count is <50.

Genitourinary Symptoms. Assessment of genitourinary complaints in HIV-positive patients requires a thorough exposure history, including recent sexual encounters. HIV-positive patients are susceptible to common genitourinary problems such as urinary tract infections; nephrolithiasis; and common sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. They are also at risk for less common genitourinary diseases such as chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and adenovirus. Medication side effects such as indinavir-related nephrolithiasis should also be considered. Workup includes a genital examination for ulcers or chancres; urinalysis and urine culture; nucleic acid testing of urine, urethral swab, or cervical swab for chlamydia and gonorrhea; fluorescent antigen testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and viral culture of genital ulcers; serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test; and, if suggested by history, workup for less common illnesses such as LGV. After a high-risk sexual exposure, chlamydia and gonorrhea are often treated empirically.

Dermatologic Symptoms. Dermatologic disease is more common in HIV-infected patients than in non-HIV-infected patients. Common dermatologic problems associated with HIV infection include viral infection of the skin and mucous membranes, such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, and molluscum contagiosum; systemic bacterial infection with a dermatologic component, such as bacillary angiomatosis (Bartonella henselae) and syphilis; superficial bacterial infection of the skin, including abscesses resulting from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); systemic fungal infection (particularly in patients with low CD4 counts), such as cryptococcosis and blastomycosis; parasitic infections, such as scabies; primary dermatologic conditions associated with HIV, such as eosinophilic folliculitis; and hypersensitivity reactions to medications such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Workup should be guided by the patient's history (with special attention to medications and exposures), the appearance of the lesion, and the absence or presence of systemic symptoms. Consider admission for patients with systemic or severe symptoms. Promptly refer to dermatology for biopsy in any case in which diagnosis or treatment is not clear.

Systemic febrile illnesses. Assessment of a febrile patient with HIV infection without localizing symptoms requires a careful history, paying particular attention to exposures, medications, CD4 cell count, and history of previous opportunistic infection. In HIV-positive patients of any CD4 cell count, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes common viral and bacterial infections such as influenza, parvovirus, hepatitis, and MRSA infection; mycobacterial infection with MAC or tuberculosis; endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis and blastomycosis; medication-related toxicities such as abacavir hypersensitivity and nevirapine-associated hepatitis; and HIV-related malignancies such as HIV-associated lymphoma. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, opportunistic infections are also a major source of fever. Pathogens causing fever in this setting include MAC, PCP, cryptococcus, CMV, and B. henselae (bacillary angiomatosis). The workup should include CBC, complete metabolic panel, blood cultures, pathogen-specific testing based on exposure (e.g., influenza testing during influenza season and induced sputum to evaluate for tuberculosis), and imaging. In patients with a low CD4 cell count, additional workup should include blood isolators for mycobacteria, serum cryptococcal antigen, and induced sputum for PCP.
