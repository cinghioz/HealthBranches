A. Obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC) occurs when this thin-walled vessel is invaded, compressed, or thrombosed. Blockage of the blood flow often leads to development of the easily recognized superior vena caval syndrome (SVCS) with venous distention, facial edema, headache, tachypnea, cyanosis, and plethora. SVCS is commonly characterized as an acute or sub-acute oncologic emergency. Establishing a diagnosis is essential and can be accomplished safely even if biopsies of tissue exposed to elevated venous pressures and a brief delay in the initiation of therapy are necessary.
B. In a patient with the previously noted signs and symptoms, confirmation that the SVC is obstructed usually is not required because most patients have a mass visible on imaging studies. However, should confirmation be needed, this can be safely accomplished with either contrast or a nuclear venography. Nuclear venography is preferable because of a lower injection volume of contrast, but both are associated with low complication rates.
C. Since the 1950s, bronchogenic carcinomas have been the leading cause of SVCS. In the past decade, with the increased use of intravascular devices, thrombosis associated with such devices now may account for approximately one fourth of cases. For many years histologic confirmation of the diagnosis was thought to be unnecessary because palliative radiotherapy was the only treatment possible. Recent advances in the treatment of lung cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders, in addition to the increasing incidence of benign causes for which radiotherapy is not palliative and is potentially dangerous, mandate accurate pretherapy assessment. Little evidence suggests that diagnostic procedures (including bronchoscopy, lymph node biopsies, mediastinoscopy, and thoracotomies) carry an excessive risk. Therefore, the evaluation of these patients should be similar to that of any patient with a lung mass.
D. Standard palliative therapy for SVCS caused by a malignancy has been radiotherapy. Some debate persists about the optimal dose, schedule, and fields of treatment, but in general, about 50%-70% of treated patients are reported to achieve symptomatic improvement within 2 weeks of initiation of radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy is no longer the sole or even the initial therapy for many patients. In one review, 60% of all cases of SVCS were caused by lung cancer or lymphomas. Thus, a majority of the causes of SVCS are malignancies for which chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy is needed to accomplish the therapeutic objectives of improved quality of life and prolonged survival. SVCS can cause distressing signs and symptoms that should be palliated in a timely fashion. However, because many such patients may have lung cancer or lymphoma together with a definite incidence of benign etiologies, an accurate histologic diagnosis should be pursued in all patients with SVCS unless there are extenuating circumstances. Only with a definite histologic diagnosis can a rational therapeutic choice be made for both relieving SVCS and maximizing survival potential.
