Cardiac murmurs are generated by turbulent blood flow and adjacent soft-tissue vibration. Turbulent or nonlaminar blood flow occurs in response to rapid acceleration or deceleration of flow such as that which occurs across a narrowed valve or vessel segment.

A. The initial goal after the detection of a murmur is to identify the portion(s) of the cardiac cycle at which the murmur can be heard. At slow heart rates (<80 beats per minute) systole can be identified by auscultation because it has a shorter duration than diastole. As heart rate increases, systole and diastole become more difficult to separate, and separation should be done by simultaneous palpation of the carotid arterial pulse. Murmurs in systole have several possible causes, including regurgitant flow across an atrioventricular (AV) valve (mitral or tricuspid), forward flow though a stenotic or abnormal semilunar valve (aortic or pulmonary), or flow through an anatomic defect (ventricular septum). Once a murmur has been determined to be systolic in timing, a series of steps can be undertaken to identify the exact cause. These include a determination of the murmur's location of optimal auscultation, configuration, quality, duration, and radiation. Provocative maneuvers can then be used to confirm the suspected pathology.
B. Location: Murmurs generated by flow across the semilunar valves are loudest in intensity at the left (pulmonic valve) and right (aortic valve) sternal border in the 2nd intercostal space (ICS). Those caused by AV valve pathology are heard lower on the chest wall at the left sternal border, 5thâ€“6th ICS (tricuspid valve), and in the mid-clavicular line, 5th-6th ICS (mitral valve). Intensity: Murmur intensity is graded on a 6-point scale, with 1 being barely audible and 6 being audible without the assistance of a stethoscope. Intensity does not reliably correlate with the amount of turbulent blood flow or with the clinical relevance of the murmur. Intensity should be assessed primarily as a means of determining a baseline, which is helpful in the assessment of disease progression and response to therapy.
C. Configuration: The murmurs of systole either have a diamond-shaped crescendo-decrescendo or a uniform, holosystolic configuration. Murmurs caused by the forward ejection of blood through one of the semilunar valves are generally of the crescendo-decrescendo variety, whereas those generated by regurgitant flow through an AV valve are usually holosystolic. Quality: Several common systolic murmurs have distinct audible qualities that can be helpful in determining the etiology. The murmur of aortic stenosis tends to be a harsh, grating murmur, whereas that of mitral regurgitation has a gentle, blowing quality. Duration: Systolic murmurs can exist for the entire duration of the systolic period or can occur only early or late in the period. AV valve regurgitation without a prolapse etiology and ventricular septal defects can be confined to early systole or can persist for the entire ejection period. Murmurs beginning after the onset of systole (late systolic) are generally caused by AV valve prolapse and ensuing regurgitation.
D. Provocative Maneuvers: Several maneuvers that alter both cardiac blood flow and intracardiac volume can be used to clarify the cause of a systolic murmur. Abrupt standing and execution of the Valsalva maneuver reduce cardiac return, thereby diminishing preload, intracardiac volume, and transvalvular flow. These maneuvers decrease the intensity of all systolic murmurs other than the murmur of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Passive leg raise, handgrip, standing and squatting, and inspiration are all maneuvers that can help to differentiate murmurs.
E. Radiation: Radiation of the murmur away from the point of loudest intensity can provide diagnostic clues. Mitral valve regurgitation murmurs can radiate to the axilla (anterior leaflet incompetence) or to the anterior chest wall (posterior leaflet incompetence). Aortic stenosis murmurs often radiate superiorly into the carotid arteries, while the otherwise-indistinguishable murmur of aortic valve sclerosis remains confined to the sternal border.
F. The management of systolic murmurs depends on the etiology, the acuity, and the hemodynamic significance of the underlying abnormality. Echocardiography can be used to confirm the cause of a systolic murmur and to determine the consequence of the structural abnormality. Both aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation can exist for long periods without the presence of clinical symptoms or the need for treatment. The development of symptoms or objective evidence of left ventricular dysfunction is an indication for valve repair
