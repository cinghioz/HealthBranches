Palpitations are a common complaint. Although usually benign, they are occasionally a life-threatening condition. A stepwise approach is helpful in avoiding unnecessary workup yet still identifying patients at high risk.
A. The initial evaluation in all patients should include a directed history and physical examination and a 12-lead ECG. The initial history should be directed toward identifying patients at high risk for having a malignant etiology of their palpitations. This group includes those with prior myocardial infarction, especially with structural heart disease with an ejection fraction (EF) of <40% and congestive heart failure; those with palpitations associated with syncope; and patients with a family history of myopathy or sudden cardiac death. The patient's description of symptoms can be helpful in suggesting a diagnosis. A “flip-flopping" of the heart, especially when lying quietly in bed, suggests ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). Rapid irregular heartbeats suggest atrial fibrillation. A sensation of pounding in the chest suggests atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and is most often seen in AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).
Palpitations in the setting of anxiety are often misdiagnosed as being psychiatric in origin, especially in young women. This diagnosis should not be accepted until true arrhythmic causes have been excluded.
The 12-lead ECG can be helpful in certain circumstances: a short PR interval and delta waves suggest Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, marked left ventricular hypertrophy with deep septal Q waves in I, aVL, and V4-6 suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; left atrial abnormalities are often seen in patients with atrial fibrillation; abnormal Q waves suggest prior MI leading to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT); and a long QT interval can be seen in polymorphic VT.
B. If the patient does not have any high-risk features and the palpitations are not particularly bothersome, then reassurance can be offered. Otherwise, ambulatory cardiac monitoring should be performed using a patient-activated continuous loop monitor for up to 2 weeks or until a diagnosis is made. This approach is more cost-effective than using a Holter monitor, which is less likely to capture a significant event as a result of its shorter monitoring period.
C. If isolated ventricular or atrial ectopy is identified as the source of palpitations, then withdrawal of potential precipitants such as caffeine or alcohol is often helpful. Reassurance is often the best therapy; however, if the patient remains highly symptomatic, then a trial of beta blockade is reasonable.
D. Management of atrial fibrillation and flutter should focus on rate vs. rhythm control and stroke prevention with anticoagulation.
E. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia, when identified, are often amenable to curative therapy with an ablation. This is especially true of AVNRT, AV reentrant trachycardia (AVRT), atrial flutter, and increasingly atrial fibrillation. This option should be offered to patients whose symptoms are especially frequent or highly symptomatic, especially if associated with syncope or near-syncope.
F. Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or with high-risk features—family history of sudden cardiac death, or structural heart disease (EF <40%)-should be referred to an electrophysiologist for appropriate management, including possible electrophysiology study (EPS), antiarrhythmic therapy, and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantation.
