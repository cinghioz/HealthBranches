A. An isolated alkaline phosphatase level is often encountered in asymptomatic patients, although a subsequent history and physical examination directed at the most common causes of such elevation often are revealing. The systems to consider are hepatobiliary and skeletal. An elevated alkaline phosphatase level is often the first sign of biliary tract disease in apparently healthy persons, although symptoms and signs of chronic liver disease may already be present. Skeletal conditions associated with elevation of alkaline phosphatase are usually painful. Serum alkaline phosphatase is also elevated in pregnancy, primarily as a result of placental production.
B. Additional laboratory tests help determine whether the elevation is of hepatobiliary origin. Serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT or GGPT) and 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) levels are usually also elevated in biliary tract disease, and other liver function tests (LFTs) may also be abnormal. The classic procedure of fractionating alkaline phosphatase by heat stability (â€œliver lives, bone burns") is infrequently performed and not well standardized in many laboratories.
C. Abnormal liver function tests require further workup, including imaging (ultrasound, CT, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]), viral and autoimmune serologies, and sometimes liver biopsy.
D. Elevated alkaline phosphatase of suspected skeletal origin should lead to evaluation of the calcium-phosphate hormonal system, with measurement of serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and 25-OH vitamin D. Elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is unlikely unless calcium is also elevated, so its measurement is not necessary in the initial series of tests. Lung cancers often synthesize PTH-related polypeptide (PTHrp), so screening for this protein, and for lung cancer by imaging, is appropriate in at-risk patients with elevated calcium. Multiple myeloma is an uncommon cause of an elevated alkaline phosphatase, so testing of serum and urinary immunoglobulins for a monoclonal component is not usually indicated. Patients with significant chronic renal insufficiency present a special case: it is wise to measure PTH regardless of the calcium level because PTH can be markedly elevated even in the presence of normal or low calcium. It is also a good idea to measure 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D because the kidney is required for the synthesis of this, the most active metabolite of vitamin D.
E. Elevated calcium and low phosphorus are characteristic of hyperparathyroidism, which should be confirmed with PTH, PTHrp testing, or both. Osteomalacia is characterized by normal calcium and low phosphorus. A vitamin D deficiency severe enough to raise the alkaline phosphatase level will usually be accompanied by this decline in phosphorus, regardless of whether symptoms and radiographic signs (e.g., osteoporosis and pseudofractures of the long bones around the knee) of osteomalacia are present. Bone metastases often increase serum calcium.
F. Paget's disease of bone features abnormal bone remodeling in sites that vary widely among patients but tend to remain constant in a patient over time. It is usually painful, and in some cases deformity is evident. Other bone diseases to consider in the setting of normal calcium-phosphate homeostasis include inflammatory arthritis and a healing fracture, both of which should be apparent by history and physical examination. As in the case of elevated calcium, metastases are an important consideration in the absence of another diagnosis.
G. Plain radiography directed at painful sites should be the initial imaging test. If these are normal, or if the patient is asymptomatic, then a radionuclide bone scan is a sensitive means of evaluating the entire skeleton for evidence of bone lesions from Paget's disease, metastases, or other (rare) infiltrative causes. Myeloma lesions are often invisible by bone scan but, as mentioned earlier, are uncommonly associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase. Any abnormality on bone scan should be followed by plain radiography or more advanced imaging (CT, MRI) of the site to assist in diagnosis.
