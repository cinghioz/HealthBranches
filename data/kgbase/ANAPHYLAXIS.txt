ANAPHYLAXIS

The common signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include
an aura, rhinitis, cough, pruritus, urticaria, laryngeal
edema, generalized edema, decreased sensorium, shock,
bronchospasm, GI cramps, and vomiting. Rarely, patients
may develop heart failure, pulmonary edema, and DIC.
Other conditions such as vasovagal reactions, hyperventilation, globus hystericus, and hereditary angioedema
may mimic aspects of anaphylaxis and should be ruled out
before initiating aggressive therapy.
A. Anaphylaxis is associated with a variety of factors,
including foods, drugs, insect bites and stings, latex,
semen, and exercise. More than one third of cases have
no identifiable cause. Drugs associated with anaphylaxis
include !-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, anesthetics,
chymopapain, protamine, dextran, vaccines, and iodinated radiocontrast media. In any patient with anaphylaxis, obtain a complete exposure history, including any
previous reactions.
B. Local reactions usually consist of redness, swelling,
and pain at the site of injection. Systemic signs and
symptoms may develop rapidly. Measures to slow

absorption of the antigen from the injection site, such
as application of ice or use of a venous (not arterial)
occluding tourniquet, may be useful in the field until
the patient reaches medical attention.
C. Base the initial management of anaphylaxis on support
of airway, breathing, and circulation. Place all patients
in the Trendelenburg position and give supplemental
oxygen. In patients with cardiac or respiratory arrest
or serious arrhythmias, initiate Basic and Advanced
Cardiac Life Support measures.
D. Epinephrine is the mainstay of therapy for anaphylaxis;
no other drug has proved as effective. Epinephrine
reverses the effects of the mediators of anaphylaxis and
may reduce the further release of these mediators. In
most adults, give 0.3–0.5 ml of 1:1000 solution by
SC injection (in children, 0.01 ml/kg). However, if the
patient is in shock, give epinephrine through a central
vein or instill into the endotracheal tube. If the desired
response is not achieved and no adverse effects occur,
repeat epinephrine in 10 minutes. Monitor elderly patients, especially those with underlying cardiac disease,
very closely.

E. In patients with severe bronchospasm, epinephrine
and inhaled !2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) are the most
effective treatment. There is no evidence that IV
theophylline is effective in the treatment of acute,
severe bronchospasm, and it may increase the risk of
cardiac arrhythmias. Early administration of an IV
corticosteroid should be considered because these
agents have a delayed onset of action. Methylprednisolone at IV dosages of 50–125 mg every 6 hours
has been used. In less severe cases, oral prednisone
may be appropriate.
F. Antihistamines serve as second-line therapy when a
prolonged course is expected. H1 blocking agents such
as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine may be especially
useful in treating pruritus. In patients with a prolonged
or refractory course, the addition of the H2 blockers,
such as ranitidine 50 mg IV or 150 mg PO, may be
helpful.
G. Instruct all patients with anaphylaxis in ways to avoid
future exposure to the inciting agent. The cause of the
episode, if known, should be documented clearly in

the patient’s medical record, especially in druginduced anaphylaxis. Because existing therapy with
beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors could worsen anaphylaxis, those agents
should be discontinued, if possible.
H. In some instances specific preventive therapy may be
indicated. Consider patients with bee-sting allergy who
cannot easily avoid future exposures for desensitization.
In patients with frequently recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis, prophylactic therapy with corticosteroids and
antihistamines has proved effective. Autoinjectors containing epinephrine also may be used by the patient at
risk for another serious reaction.
