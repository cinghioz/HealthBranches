MAMMAL BITES
It is difficult to determine the incidence of animal bites
because the vast majority of people bitten do not seek
medical treatment. Most patients with bites who present for
emergency care have been bitten by dogs, cats, or rodents.
Most animal bites can be managed safely as outpatient
procedures, except for those patients requiring surgical
reconstruction or IV antibiotics for postbite infections.
Treatment of bite injuries follows that for traumatic injury
and laceration care, with special attention to wound irrigation and debridement and prophylaxis of potential infectious complications, including rabies and tetanus.
A. Initial treatment of bite injury requires aggressive wound
cleansing with soap and water and copious irrigation.
Wound cleansing within 3 hours of a bite injury substantially reduces the risk of rabies transmission. In most
areas with a municipal water supply, tap water is perfectly sufficient for high-volume wound irrigation.
B. Patients should receive tetanus immunization for any
bite with potential skin breakage if the patient has not
been immunized within the previous 5 years.
Rabies treatment differs for different animal bites,
and prevalence of rabies in specific animals may differ
depending on the region of the country. Most rabies
exposures in the United States occur from wild animals, with skunks, foxes, raccoons, and bats being the
primary culprits. This varies greatly by region and
country; one must contact the local heath department
to determine whether a bite carries a risk for rabies.
Once a patient is infected with rabies, the infection is
almost universally fatal. If a patient is bitten by a dog,
cat, or ferret, rabies prophylaxis should be held unless
the animal develops signs or symptoms of rabies. If the
animal is unavailable, then consult the local health
department. Bites by skunks, foxes, bats, raccoons, and

any wild carnivores should be considered rabid, and
the patient should be given prophylaxis for rabies. Any
contact with any bat, including a scratch, should be
considered a rabid bite, and prophylaxis should be administered. Other animals need to be considered individually.
C. Animal bites have different rates of infectious potential
depending on the animal, the area of the wound, the
extent of the wound, and the comorbidities of the
patient (Table 1).

D. Many bite injuries result in crush injury to tissue
and may result in penetrating injuries. Nonviable tissue
must be removed, and all puncture-type injuries must be
explored for possible retained foreign body or substance
and to inspect underlying structure such as muscle fascia
and tendon. Injuries to hands resulting from a closed-fist
punch to a mouth that causes a laceration over the joint
should be treated as a human bite.
E Lacerations from bite injuries should be repaired in
the typical fashion with approximation of viable tissue.
Those bites that are at high risk for infection will have
to be considered for management with delayed primary closure where the wound is essentially left open
for 48–72 hours and then repaired. The cosmetic outcome and the functionality of the injured area must be
considered (box and Table 2).
Essentials of Bite Care
Presentation
• Perform ABCs.
• Examine wound with attention to vascular and neurologic
examinations.
• Elevate wound above level of heart, if possible.
• Take history, including circumstances of injury and information
on animal (species of animal, wild or domestic, in captivity or
not, etc.).
• Determine whether patient has a predisposing history for infection (diabetes, immunocompromise, etc.)
• Perform x-ray.
Wound Care
• Irrigate and clean wound.
• Use soap and water for rabies-prone wounds.
• Debride nonviable tissue, explore for foreign bodies or retained
material.
Discharge
• Administer tetanus prophylaxis and prophylactic antibiotics,
depending on specific of injury.
• Administer rabies prophylaxis if indicated.
• Follow-up within 36 hours.

F. Prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated depending
on the species of animal, the extent of tissue damage,
and the comorbidities of the patient (Table 3).
