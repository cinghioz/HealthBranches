Acute pulmonary edema is an emergency that necessitates admission to the hospital. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from an increase in left atrial pressure with a resultant increase in pulmonary venous and capillary pressure. This results in extravasation of fluid into the alveoli and impairment of gas exchange in the lungs.

A. The initial history and physical examination should be targeted toward confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, assessing the severity, and identifying any immediate underlying precipitants. Symptoms may include acute or progressive shortness of breath, cough, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and occasionally hemoptysis. Clinical signs include tachypnea, tachycardia, an ausculatory S3 or S4, elevation in the jugular venous pressure, crackles, and hypoxia depending on the degree of alveolar edema.
B. Of significant importance to the initial patient assessment is the identification of patients with imminent respiratory failure who will require early and intensive therapy with either invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. All patients should be provided with supplemental oxygen. ABGs may be required to assess adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation.
C. Patients with signs of hypoperfusion, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <90 mm Hg, cool extremities, altered mental status, and poor urine output, may be candidates for early hemodynamic support with inotropic therapy or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Urgent coronary angiography and revascularization should be performed if myocardial ischemia is suspected as the etiology of pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.
D. The initial diagnostic workup should focus on the confirmation of pulmonary edema, identification of the severity, and investigation for an underlying cause. Chest radiograph may show bilateral perihilar edema and cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings. An ECG may identify any arrhythmias, ischemia, or injury. A serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of <100 pg/ml makes the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) very unlikely, whereas a BNP of >500 pg/ml increases the likelihood of HF. Occasionally, right-sided heart catheterization may be required to confirm the diagnosis and establish the hemodynamic profile. Baseline renal and electrolyte testing is critical to assess the contribution of renal insufficiency to the clinical picture. An echocardiogram will provide useful information about systolic, diastolic, and valvular function.
E. If the clinical assessment and supporting diagnostic evaluations do not support a diagnosis of pulmonary edema, other pulmonary conditions, including pneumonia, acute pulmonary embolism, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), should be considered.
F. Therapy should be instituted immediately, often concurrently with diagnostic evaluation. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a manifestation of high left-sided filling pressures; thus investigation and management should be tailored to the specific causes:
• Acute ischemia—This is evidenced by history, ischemic ECG changes, and abnormal cardiac enzymes. Therapy will involve appropriate treatment for the acute coronary syndrome concurrent with HF therapy.
• Acute arrhythmia—HF can result from either tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias, and therapy will depend on the primary rhythm disturbance.
• Valvular—Acute mitral regurgitation and aortic insufficiency in particular may present in this fashion. Acute management involves hemodynamic stabilization with pharmacologic and/or mechanical afterload and preload reduction and surgical consultation.
• Hypertensive crisis—IV agents, such as nitroprusside or labetalol, should be used to acutely lower the mean arterial pressure by 25%-30%.
• Acutely decompensated chronic HF—Anemia, infection, dietary indiscretion, and medication noncompliance are all other potential causes precipitating pulmonary edema in those with chronic HF.
G. The dose of diuretic will vary among individual patients. All patients with pulmonary edema should receive IV diuretics to ensure a quick response and assist with pulmonary venous dilation. In individuals taking chronic diuretics, an initial estimate is to administer an IV dose that is double the patient's baseline oral dose. In patients who are diuretic naïve, an initial IV dose of furosemide 0.5-1.0 mg/kg can be used. If an adequate response is not seen within 1 hour, the dose of diuretic should be doubled.
H. IV vasodilator therapy may have many beneficial effects in patients with acute pulmonary edema, including relief of cardiac ischemia (nitroglycerin), pulmonary vasodilation (nitroprusside, nesiritide, and nitroglycerin), improvement in dyspnea (IV nesiritide, IV nitroglycerin), and reduction in afterload (nitroprusside).
I. The use of inotropic support in acute pulmonary edema should be reserved for patients presenting with advanced symptoms of congestion combined with evidence of hypoperfusion. When used, the dose of inotrope should be titrated slowly to a hemodynamic goal (dobutamine 2-10 µg/kg/min, dopamine 1-5 µg/kg/min, or milrinone 0.375–0.75 µg/kg/min), such as improvement in blood pressure or improved clinical perfusion manifest by an increase in pulse pressure, mental status, or increased urine output. Attempts should be made to wean inotropic therapy as soon as possible once the patient is stabilized.
