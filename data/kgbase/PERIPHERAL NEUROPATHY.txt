Peripheral neuropathies can affect peripheral sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves and on occasion the cranial nerves. Diagnosis is challenging because of the multiplicity of peripheral neuropathies. Thus, it is essential to perform a detailed history and examination to narrow the differential diagnosis.

A. In taking a detailed history, consider the following questions. What systems are involved? Are the symptoms mainly sensory, motor, or a combination of both? Is there an autonomic neuropathy (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, impaired sweating, constipation, diarrhea, impotence, gastroparesis)? Sensory nerve fibers are commonly involved, but this may be a result of large- or small-fiber dysfunction. Patients with a small-fiber neuropathy present with severe neuropathic pain. Complaints of positive phenomena (e.g., burning, prickling, tingling) are useful in differentiating hereditary from acquired forms of peripheral neuropathy. Patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) generally do not have positive symptoms. In addition, patients whose main complaint is severe incoordination and ataxia from loss of proprioception typically have loss of the sensory nerve ganglion, known as ganglionopathy or neuronopathy. What was the temporal nature of the neuropathy in terms of onset and progression? Neuropathies may be acute (evolution over hours to 1 month), subacute (evolution over 1-2 months), or chronic (progression over 2 months) in onset, and the subsequent course can be monophasic, relapsing-remitting, stable, or slowly or rapidly progressive. It is important to inquire into past medical history, medications, illicit drug use, toxic exposures, and family history. Primary systemic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, cancer) can cause peripheral neuropathy and may be the presenting manifestation of the disease. Patients should be asked about their work to see if they are exposed to toxins. Also, risk factors for HIV infection should be explored, particularly in patients with otherwise unexplained peripheral neuropathy. A detailed family history is essential to address whether the neuropathy is hereditary or acquired. Some family members may be only very mildly affected, so a family history is not always apparent to the patient or other family members. Electrophysiologic studies of family members may clarify this.

B. What is the pattern of motor and sensory involvement? Is it symmetric or asymmetric? Is weakness proximal and/or distal? Is the face or trunk affected? Axonal neuropathies manifest in a length-dependent manner, so the distal territories of the longest nerves are the most severely and initially affected. As a result, a symmetric stocking-glove distribution of symptoms and signs is seen. If the arms are more involved than the legs, or the proximal extremities are more affected than distal extremities, this suggests a demyelinating neuropathy or ganglionopathy, which is not length dependent. If there is proximal weakness with no or minimal sensory symptoms, this should raise the concern of a myopathy, neuromuscular junction defect, or spinal muscular atrophy instead of a peripheral neuropathy. Nevertheless, severe proximal weakness can be seen in certain types of peripheral neuropathy. Also, although distal weakness is most often seen in peripheral neuropathies, a few myopathies can present with significant distal weakness (distal muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and inclusion body myositis). Additionally, myasthenia gravis can also rarely present with distal weakness. The different sensory modalities (pain, touch, temperature, vibration, and proprioception) should be assessed in all patients. Large-diameter sensory nerves mainly convey deep touch and proprioception, whereas temperature and pain are conveyed by small-diameter nerve fibers. Vibratory perception is carried by both large- and small-diameter nerve fibers. Small-diameter nerve fibers are preferentially affected in some neuropathies (e.g., amyloid neuropathy), whereas other neuropathies have a predilection for larger fibers (e.g., chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [CIDP]). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myopathy, or myasthenia gravis, the sensory examination should be normal unless the patient has a concurrent neuropathy. Detailed motor strength testing elucidates the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy. Muscles should be inspected for evidence of abnormal movements (e.g., fasciculations, myokymia), which are seen in certain neuropathic conditions (e.g., ALS, radiation plexopathy). Muscle tone is usually normal or diminished in a peripheral neuropathy, whereas spastic tone is suggestive of ALS. Ankle jerks are usually lost relatively early on in axonal neuropathies. If upper extremity reflexes are lost or there is a generalized early areflexia, this is suggestive of a demyelinating process or ganglionopathy. Upper motor neuron signs such as pathologically brisk reflexes and extensor plantar responses are not seen in peripheral neuropathies unless there is additional CNS dysfunction, as in ALS. Patients should be asked to walk on their heels and toes because this can unmask subtle distal leg weakness. Asking the patient to stand with feet together and eyes closed assesses the function of the large-diameter sensory neurons and the posterior columns, which are abnormal in ganglionopathy or a spinocerebellar degeneration (Romberg's sign will be present in these disorders).

C. The electrophysiologic evaluation involves electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). These studies are often essential in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, can illuminate patterns that are consistent with particular families of disorders, and will often essentially rule out other disorders. A consultation with a neurologist can be valuable in planning the approach to electrodiagnostic testing.
