ACUTE ANTICOAGULATION


Thromboembolic disorders and medical procedures that
may require anticoagulation therapy include proximal deep
venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial
fibrillation with embolism, acute myocardial infarction,
acute coronary syndrome, and placement of mechanical
heart valves. In situations of apparent thromboembolic
disorders (as opposed to prophylaxis) that are potentially
life threatening (e.g., PE with shock), initiate heparin
therapy before performing diagnostic tests.
A. Diagnostic tests vary in sensitivity and specificity. In
patients with PE, a high degree of clinical suspicion may
necessitate therapy even when the helical CT scan or
ventilation-perfusion scan is inconclusive or negative.
B. Contraindications to heparin are relative: The risks
must be weighed against the potential benefits. In

most cases, patients with previous hypersensitivity or
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; active bleeding;
intracranial hemorrhage; GI bleeding; hemophilia;
thrombocytopenia; severe hypertension; or recent surgery of the brain, spinal cord, or eye should not receive
heparin therapy. In patients with PE in whom there
are contraindications to heparin therapy, consider
placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
C. In patients with massive PE or those with hemodynamic compromise, consider thrombolytic therapy
with urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).
However, clinical trials have shown no clear advantage
of thrombolytic therapy over heparin in most patients
with venous thromboembolism.

D. Several studies show that a weight-based approach to
administering heparin achieves more rapid anticoagulation without increased risk of bleeding. Many institutions
have developed heparin-dosing protocols to facilitate
the appropriate use of heparin. However, use of such
protocols does not obviate the need for close clinical and
laboratory monitoring by the physician. Check partial
thromboplastin time (PTT) no sooner than 6 hours after
any bolus; PTT checked sooner may be falsely elevated.
The PTT target for heparin therapy must be based
on values derived by individual laboratories. Many
laboratories now standardize the PTT assay based on
heparin levels. The PTT-based dose changes must
be based on local laboratory standards, and published
protocol can serve only as a guide.
E. A variety of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
products such as enoxaparin have been marketed. These
agents appear to be at least as effective as unfractionated
heparin (UFH), do not require PTT monitoring, and
can be administered by intermittent SC injection. However, these products are much more expensive than
UFH and offer no particular advantage in the patient
who is hospitalized. Several studies show that LMWH
can be administered safely to outpatients with DVT or
PE. A patient who is medically stable and has the appropriate home environment and insurance coverage
may be discharged on LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg
SC q12h or 1.5 mg/kg q24h). Such therapy is continued

until the level of long-term anticoagulation (warfarin) is
therapeutic.
F. If long-term anticoagulation is indicated and there are
no contraindications to warfarin, initiate warfarin as
soon as the PTT is therapeutic. The initial warfarin dose
should be the same as the expected maintenance dose.
There is no pharmacologic rationale for, and there is no
outcome evidence supporting, the use of warfarin
“loading” doses. Continue heparin therapy for at least
4 days after the initiation of warfarin. Earlier increases
in the prothrombin time/International Normalized
Ratio (PT/INR) result primarily from depletion of
factor VII. Patients are not truly anticoagulated until
significant depletion of factors II and X has occurred.
