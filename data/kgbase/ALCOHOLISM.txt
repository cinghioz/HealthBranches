Patients with alcohol problems rarely present with a chief complaint of problem drinking. More commonly they exhibit various complications of alcohol abuse. Some are psychological in nature (fatigue, anxiety, depression, insomnia, deteriorating relationships, domestic violence, and impaired work performance); others are somatic (palpitations, weakness, gastric upset, headaches). Emergency department physicians commonly encounter patients who are acutely intoxicated and brought in by police because of assaultive behavior, public intoxication, or driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI). Anxiety and depressive mood disorders are the most commonly occurring psychiatric disorders with alcohol dependence. Alcoholism is the primary diagnosis in 25% of suicides. It is also a significant contributor to birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome. The physician must maintain a high index of suspicion to avoid missing this common diagnosis. Consider alcohol-related problems in nearly every patient. This includes special populations, such as patients who are physicians. Nearly every state has distinct programs designed to guide and monitor recovery.
A. History is the key to a diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence; however, patients often distort the history and minimize the problem. Denial is a strong defense in all those who abuse alcohol or drugs. Compounding denial are the recent studies that cite moderate alcohol consumption with decreased risk of heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cognitive decline. Thus, it often is necessary to interview family members to obtain an accurate drinking history and symptoms of abuse or dependence. Review patients' alcohol and drug use history in detail. Look for problems in social (divorce, job loss, family arguments, use in other family members), legal (DUI, DWI), and medical (gastritis, peptic ulcer, hepatitis, anemia) areas of the patient's life. It is important to identify negative consequences that suggest loss of control and support a diagnosis of dependence. Compulsive use and preoccupation with drinking complete the criteria for dependence or addiction. The mnemonic CPR (compulsivity, preoccupation, relapse) is useful for recalling the essential features of dependence. Also review the family history because alcoholism shows strong family trends. Physiologic dependence often is present but not required for the diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
B. Physical examination should be detailed and thorough. Patients with cirrhosis, ascites, edema, rhinophyma, peripheral neuropathy, and jaundice characterize end-stage alcoholism. These patients usually have been drinking uncontrollably for >10 years. Physical complications of alcohol are late findings and may not be evident early in the disease. Increased rates of oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, and liver cancers are seen with chronic alcohol use.
C. Laboratory screening can be informative. Look for elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT). Typically, the AST is greater than the ALT. The GGT is a more sensitive indicator of alcohol-induced liver damage. The CBC often shows elevated mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin with prolonged regular use of alcohol. Hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia often are present. Blood alcohol level of >300 mg/dl in an alert patient indicates significant tolerance.
D. Using the data thus far collected, the physician can usually make a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, dependence, or polysubstance dependence. The DSM-IV-TR lists the criteria for substance dependence and substance abuse. Seven criteria are included for a diagnosis of substance dependence, three of the seven criteria being required for a formal diagnosis. In addition, there are the categories of with and without physiologic dependence. There are also specifiers to further clarify the exact course of the illness. Four criteria are diagnostic for substance abuse. Only one of these criteria need be present for the formal diagnosis.
E. Dual diagnosis refers to substance abuse or dependence plus another major psychiatric diagnosis such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorder. These patients can be extremely difficult to diagnose and treat because substance abuse often causes or mimics many psychiatric syndromes. Conversely, there is a significant amount of comorbidity with depressive and anxiety disorders in patients who are alcohol dependent. Psychiatric consultation is suggested. Successful treatment of alcohol problems requires identification and treatment of all other comorbid psychiatric problems.
F. Individualize treatment to the particular patient's needs. Merely telling the patient to quit drinking is futile and potentially dangerous. Consultation with an experienced psychiatrist or addictionist is strongly recommended. Referral to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or another support group is an excellent place to begin
