SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION

A. Although a few patients will volunteer sexual difficulties, most will not. A detailed medical history should
include a sexual history to elicit complaints. Ask general, nonjudgmental questions, including effects on
current relationships, to open the discussion. Make no
assumptions about a patient’s sexual preferences or
experiences.
B. Decreased libido can be associated with depression,
other psychiatric disorders, or their medical treatment.
Stress in relationships or work can also contribute. Psychiatric evaluation and counseling can help. Medical
causes of decreased sexual desire include medications
(e.g., antihypertensives or selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors [SSRIs], substance abuse, and acute and
chronic illness. Hypogonadism is treatable with testosterone replacement therapy. Sex and/or marital therapy
should be considered for patients with significant relationship problems (as either a cause or a result of decreased libido).
C. Erectile dysfunction, or impotence, can be classified as
organic or psychogenic, although many men have a mixture of both. The presence of morning erections is
highly specific for psychogenic impotence, although not
very sensitive. There are a number of organic causes for
erectile dysfunction, including endocrine, vascular, and
neurologic disorders. Surgical procedures such as radical prostatectomy may result in erectile dysfunction as
well. A careful history and physical will help elicit organic etiologies. Check testosterone level in organic
impotence. Routine serologic screening for other endocrine disorders is not warranted in the absence of
other indicators found in the history and physical.

Medications (e.g., antihypertensives and SSRIs) have
been implicated. Acute and chronic illness can contribute to organic and psychological erectile dysfunction. A
nocturnal penile tumescence test using stamps or an
inexpensive strain gauge will more reliably differentiate
one from the other. However, in either case first-line
therapy should be PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil,
vardenafil, or tadalafil (with others on the way) unless
contraindicated. PDE5 inhibitors must be avoided in
patients taking oral or topical nitrates. Other options for
treatment include injection therapies, prostaglandin
agents such as alprostadil, or external devices that
enhance erections (e.g., penile rings or vacuum pumps).
Sex therapy can also be useful for patients with a psychological component. Referral to urology is appropriate
in refractory cases.
D. Premature ejaculation is a common complaint among
men who are young and sexually inexperienced. It is
also seen in patients having relationship or situational
stresses and is well known to occur with fatigue. Therapy was once limited to the pause (or hold) and
squeeze technique in addition to increased sexual
stimulation, which is thought to increase the latency
period. SSRIs have shown efficacy in delaying ejaculation, and PDE5 inhibitors are now being studied as
well. Sex therapy can be helpful in some cases. Absent
ejaculation may be organic and a result of hypogonadism or a complication of prostate surgery. Retrograde
ejaculation requires referral to urology. Rarely, anorgasmia occurs in the absence of hypogonadism and is
best addressed by sex therapy.

E. Hypoactive sexual desire in women, as in men, can be
associated with medications (e.g., antihypertensives,
SSRIs), substance abuse, and chronic illness. It can
accompany menopause (natural or surgical). Appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can improve
sexual desire, especially if lack of desire is related to
dyspareunia (painful intercourse) resulting from inadequate lubrication. Given the newly recognized risks of
HRT, a physician must weigh the benefit against the
risk. Women who have had bilateral oophorectomy or
who suffer from severe androgen deficiency as in
Addison’s disease may benefit from androgen replacement therapy. Depression, difficulties with body image, and the maternal role also can decrease female
desire. Reducing fatigue with the addition of regular
exercise often is accompanied by an increase in sexual
desire. A history of sexual abuse or domestic violence
may present as hypoactive sexual desire and avoidance
of sexual contact. Depression can be treated medically,
although many antidepressants have decreased sexual
desire as a prominent side effect (studies using PDE5
inhibitors to overcome this are under way). Psychiatric
referral is appropriate for all women with a history of
sexual abuse and may be appropriate for treatment of
hypoactive sexual desire regardless of cause.
F. Anorgasmia is much more common in women than in
men. Often it is a combination of inhibition relating to
sex itself and a lack of knowledge about female sexual
arousal. Education about anatomy and use of selfstimulation coupled with erotic materials may enhance
a woman’s sexual experience. Sex therapy can also be
useful in these cases. Medications such as SSRIs or
pelvic trauma also can lead to reduced ability to
achieve orgasm.
G. Dyspareunia is a common sexual complaint of women.
It is important to distinguish between insertional (just
before or during penile penetration) and deep thrust

dyspareunia. Insertional pain has a number of easily
reversed causes such as vulvovaginitis, urethritis, and
inadequate lubrication. Treatment with antibiotics
when indicated and the use of topical estrogens in
perimenopausal or postmenopausal women can eliminate the problem. Atrophic vaginitis often responds to
estrogen replacement as well. Vulvar dystrophies, vulvar vestibulitis, and urethral syndromes require gynecologic referral. Pelvic inflammatory disease can be
treated with antibiotics. Most other causes of deep
thrust dyspareunia require gynecologic evaluation.
H. Vaginismus is a severe type of insertional dyspareunia.
The patient complains of inability to achieve penetration—she may be unable to insert a tampon or tolerate a
speculum examination—secondary to involuntary muscle contraction. If there is no history of sexual abuse, it
may be related to fear and inhibition surrounding sex.
Education about anatomy and sexual response coupled
with insertion of progressively larger vaginal dilators may
allow receptive penetration. Botulinum toxin is being
studied as a potential medical therapy for severe cases.
Sex therapy, psychiatric evaluation, or both may also be
required. A history of sexual abuse demands psychiatric
referral.
