A. Normal grief responses vary. The process of grieving may be seen as occurring in three stages: initial shock or numbing, acute mourning, and a period of resolution or recovery. A lack of perceived social support is one predictor of difficulty in recovery. Those seen as grieving most intensely early in the bereavement may have a poorer outcome after 1 year than those with a relative absence of mourning. There is little evidence to support the efficacy of treatment for people experiencing uncomplicated bereavement.
B. Neurovegetative symptoms of depression are common in bereavement. Sleep disturbance may last for up to 1 year. Appetite usually returns within 4 months after the loss. However, motor retardation, ruminative guilt, and a feeling of worthlessness are not typical symptoms of bereavement and suggest the need for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
C. Symptoms of complicated grief are distinct from symptoms of bereavement-related depression and anxiety. Persistent symptoms of anxiety and depression warrant a more detailed psychiatric evaluation. Patients who are clinically depressed are most often treated with a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy.
D. More than 40% of bereaved spouses have at least one type of anxiety disorder during the first year of bereavement. A history of anxiety disorder is a strong predictor of its presenting during bereavement. Anxiety symptoms include somatic distress, obsessions and compulsions, phobias, and panic attacks.
E. Antidepressants are useful in the treatment of most anxiety disorders and may be preferred to benzodiazepines because of the lack of dependence potential.
F. A history of an addictive disorder is a strong predictor of substance abuse during grieving. Because there is a significant risk of morbidity and mortality with substance abuse, it is imperative that a careful history be taken and that bothersome symptoms of anxiety and sleeplessness be treated nonpharmacologically or with medications that have minimal addiction potential.
G. In normal grief the intensity of the emotional pain gradually decreases; significant resolution occurs by 1 year. Theories of attachment behavior have been used to explain the difficulties that complicate the grieving process for some people.
H. It is suggested that expressive psychotherapy is most appropriate for conflicted grief syndromes, cognitive treatment may be particularly useful for dependent grief syndrome, and treatments developed specifically for persons with posttraumatic stress disorder may be most useful for those who have had a sudden, unexpected loss.
