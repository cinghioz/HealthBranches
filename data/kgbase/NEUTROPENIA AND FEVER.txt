NEUTROPENIA AND FEVER

Infection during episodes of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the most common cause of treatment-related
mortality in patients with cancer. Most infections originate
in the alimentary tract, sinuses, lungs, and skin. The risk of
infection in a patient with neutropenia primarily is dictated
by the severity and duration of neutropenia. The lower the
absolute granulocyte nadir and the more prolonged the
neutropenia, the greater the risk of serious infection. Fever is common in patients with cancer and may have many
causes, including infection, the tumor itself, inflammation,
transfusion of blood products, and chemotherapeutic and
antimicrobial drugs. In patients with neutropenia, however,
fever (a single temperature !38.3° C orally or !38° C over
at least 1 hour) usually is secondary to infection, especially
if the patient has "500 granulocytes/#l.
A. In addition to identifying localizing symptoms, the
medical history should focus on special immunologic
circumstances or defects that may predispose the patient to opportunistic infections. For example, patients
with Hodgkin’s disease are at increased risk for herpes
zoster and cryptococcal meningitis; those who have
undergone bone marrow transplantation are at risk for
severe interstitial pneumonia with cytomegalovirus
(CMV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and those
taking high-dose steroids are at increased risk for
pneumocystis pneumonia and fungal infections. Steroid use may further hide the signs and symptoms
of infection, masking the seriousness of the clinical
presentation. For instance, delirium may be the
only manifestation of a serious infection in a patient
receiving high-dose steroids.
B. A thorough physical examination must include careful
auscultation of the lungs and meticulous evaluation
of the integument, oral cavity, genitalia, and perianal
region. Evaluation of the entire integument should
focus especially on sites of vascular access and previous
invasive procedures as potential portals for infection.
The characteristic signs and symptoms of infections
may be absent in patients with neutropenia who are
unable to mount an adequate inflammatory response.
C. In addition to routine blood tests, culture blood from
two separate sites, culture urine, and order a chest
radiograph. Perform other tests such as stool culture,
lumbar puncture, abdominal radiography, and bronchoscopy only if clinically indicated. For instance, in
patients with diarrhea, culture for bacteria, ova, and
parasite and perform a toxic screen for Clostridium difficile. Even with a comprehensive evaluation, a specific
pathogen is initially identified in only 30%–50%

of patients. With profound neutropenia ("100 cells/#l),
bacteremias can be documented in only 15%–20% of
febrile episodes.
Antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogens
most likely to be responsible for the primary infection.
Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, especially Klebsiella,
Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, account
for 30%–40% of all culture-confirmed infections. The
incidence of gram-positive cocci (e.g., Staphylococcus
aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci,
pneumococci, Corynebacterium spp.) has risen significantly and now represents 60%–70% of isolates in many
hospitals. Monotherapy with carbapenems (imipenem
or meropenem), cefepime, or occasionally ceftazidime
is acceptable for uncomplicated episodes of fever in
patients with neutropenia, particularly in those with
fever of unknown origin. Although, alternatively, aminoglycosides may be given in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin in all patients with fever and
neutropenia, aminoglycosides may be added to a
third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin or carbapenems in patients with documented P. aeruginosa infection, pneumonia, or sepsis with mental status changes or
hypoxemia with the emergence of vancomycin-resistant
gram-positives such as E. faecium. Use vancomycin only
in (1) patients with catheter-related infection with
catheter site inflammation, (2) patients who received
quinolone prophylaxis, (3) patients with severe mucositis, or (4) patients known to have been colonized with
methicillin-resistant S. aureus or penicillin-resistant
S. pneumoniae.
If the patient becomes afebrile within 48 hours, no
organism is identified, all sites of infection resolve,
and the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is !500/#l,
discontinue the antibiotic regimen after 7 days.
If a patient remains neutropenic but has been afebrile
for $5 days, has stable vital signs, and is without mucositis but has an ANC 100–500/#l, discontinue antibiotics
and monitor closely. If the temperature increases again,
panculture immediately and resume broad-spectrum
antibiotics. Patients with neutropenia at high risk (ANC
"100/#l or with mucositis or unstable vital signs) should
be continued on antibiotics until ANC is !500/#l and
the patient is clinically improved.
Patients who remain neutropenic and febrile at day 4 but
are clinically improved may continue the same initial
regimen for a total of 7 days. However, if there is clinical
deterioration, modify the antibiotic regimen depending
on the clinical picture. For instance, for patients with
severe mucositis or catheter site inflammation who have

a high likelihood of a gram-positive infection, vancomycin may be added if not previously included. For patients
with pneumonia or sepsis syndrome, add aminoglycoside, IV quinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin), or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (if not previously included) to cover
resistant gram-negatives such as P. aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, respectively. Add fluconazole
if the patient is febrile through day 5 and resolution of
neutropenia is not imminent. If the patient received
fluconazole prophylaxis before the onset of fever, consider amphotericin B. Even if the patient is clinically
improved while receiving antibiotics, perform a thorough examination daily, including the skin, oral cavity,
genitalia, perianal area, and sites of venous access as
outlined previously. Take seriously any medical complaint, and pursue the cause immediately. For instance,
mild discomfort in the maxillary region is often the first

sign of a grave fungal infection caused by Aspergillus or
Mucor; tenderness in the perianal area may indicate a
superimposed anaerobic infection; and right-sided abdominal discomfort may be the first clue to the diagnosis
of typhlitis.
