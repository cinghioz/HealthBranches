Phosphorus is a critical component of many cellular compounds (e.g., phospholipids of the cell membrane, nucleic acid, adenosine triphospate [ATP], 2,3-diphosphoglycerate [2,3-DPG]) and plays a key role in an array of metabolic processes. Consequently it is under tight regulatory control. Serum levels of phosphate depend on dietary intake, intestinal absorption, bone turnover, cellular shifts, and renal tubular handling. Homeostasis is maintained primarily by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. The total body phosphorus in a 70-kg adult is estimated to be 700 g: 85% is in the skeleton, 15% is in the soft tissue, and 0.1% is in the extracellular fluid.
A. Hypophosphatemia is defined as a plasma phosphate level <2.5 mg/dl. Causes of hypophosphatemia are shown in Table 1. Hypophosphatemia can occur when there are increased losses, decreased intake, or cellular shifts of phosphate. In order to delineate among the causes, it is important to obtain a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. Hypophosphatemia secondary to decreased input occurs when there is decreased oral intake or intestinal absorption. Hypophosphatemia resulting from poor intake is uncommon, because phosphorus is plentiful in the diet. It can occur, however, when an individual has been chronically and severely malnourished. Malabsorption of phosphorus is often secondary to inflammatory states, surgery, or diarrhea. The most common cause of hypophosphatemia is chronic alcoholism. Over 50% of the hospitalized alcoholics become hypophosphatemic when they are unable to eat for a period of days or develop an alcohol withdrawal state. Increased renal clearance of phosphorus occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D-resistant and vitamin D-dependent rickets, hyperglycemic states, and oncogenic osteomalacia. There are acquired and hereditary conditions that lead to increased losses of phosphate. Intracellular shifts of phosphorus by insulin infusion can cause an abrupt fall in serum phosphorus, but this is usually transient and usually does not result in a profound deficiency. Finally, cellular shifts can cause hypophosphatemia. This is most often seen with the administration of glucose or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in malnourished patients. A rise in insulin causes phosphate to move to the intracellular compartment. Additionally, the increased anabolism leads to the formation of high-energy phosphate bonds, further depleting phosphate levels. A similar mechanism is involved in hypophosphatemia resulting from insulin administration in treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (HONK).
B. The clinical manifestations of hypophosphatemia depend on the severity and duration of low plasma phosphate levels. Patients with moderate hypophosphatemia (1.5–2.5 mg/dl) are generally asymptomatic. Those with severe hypophosphatemia (<1.5 mg/dl) can have metabolic encephalopathy, bone pain, or symptoms secondary to muscle dysfunction (decreased strength, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure). Hypophosphatemic patients may also demonstrate hematologic abnormalities (hemolysis secondary to decreased 2,3-DGP and ATP levels, leukocyte dysfunction, thrombocytopenia). When deciding how to manage hypophosphatemia, it is important to keep in mind that serum levels of phosphate do not necessarily reflect total body stores. Hypophosphatemia can occur when total stores are low, normal, or high. Clinically significant hypophosphatemia tends to occur when there is a total-body deficit of phosphorus.
C. Phosphorus can be replaced orally or parenterally. Orally is considered safer. Oral therapies include phosphate-containing salts (sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate) and dairy products (e.g., milk contains 1 mg/ml of phosphorus). Generally, for oral replacement, 60 mmol of phosphate per day in 3–4 divided doses of the preparation of choice, given over 7–10 days is sufficient to correct moderate hypophosphatemia. Parenteral therapy is usually reserved for severe hypophosphatemia or for those who do not tolerate or respond to oral preparations. IV formulations include sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate. A common regimen is 2.5 mg/kg body weight of phosphate over 6 hours in severe hypophosphatemia without overt clinical manifestations, and 5.0 mg/kg body weight over 6 hours in hypophosphatemic emergencies. Phosphate repletion can have side effects. When phosphate-containing salts are used, patients need to be followed closely for hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and volume overload. With oral salt supplements patients may have diarrhea. This can be avoided by administering divided doses. During parenteral repletion it is also important to monitor the calcium phosphate product. Overaggressive repletion can lead to metastatic calcium deposition and hypocalcemia. In addition to correcting plasma levels of phosphorus, the underlying causes of hypophosphatemia need to be identified and treated.
