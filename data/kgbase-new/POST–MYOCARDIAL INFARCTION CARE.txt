Management and counseling of patients after myocardial infarction (MI) should be focused on the evaluation and modification of factors contributing to this disease process, treatment of complications such as heart failure and dysrhythmia, and control of recurrent angina. Interventions include education, behavioral modification, and pharmacologic secondary prevention. In some cases referral for further testing and invasive intervention may be required.
A. The history should include details of the patient's hospital course and general medical history. Details of the hospital course should include the extent of cardiac injury, treatment (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], coronary artery bypass graph [CABG], conservative therapy), complications (arrhythmia, heart failure), and any diagnostic studies performed prior to discharge (ECG, stress testing). Discharge medications and any adverse reactions to medications should be noted. General history should include symptoms of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), tobacco use, dietary and exercise habits, diabetes, and drug use.
B. The examination should include evaluation for signs of ventricular dysfunction, valvular disease, or arrhythmia. Blood pressure, weight/body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference should be measured.
C. Laboratory testing should include creatinine; fasting lipids; fasting glucose; and, in the case of patients with diabetes, a hemoglobin Alc.
D. Testing of patients after MI should include a resting ECG and in most cases an echocardiogram. To accurately assess convalescent ventricular function, the echocardiogram should be performed after 6 weeks. However, earlier testing is warranted if it will be used for decision making. In patients managed without angiography or (in some cases) with incomplete revascularization, a submaximal stress test should be performed prior to hospital discharge. Exercise testing is preferred to pharmacologic stress.
E. Risk assessment should include evaluation for left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, high-risk indicators on stress testing, symptoms concerning for arrhythmia, or moderate to severe anginal symptoms. In some cases cardiac catheterization, electrophysiology evaluation, or additional revascularization may be indicated.
F. Education should be provided for both the patient and family. Emphasis is placed on the importance of lifestyle changes (tobacco cessation, exercise, weight loss, and dietary restrictions) and their impact on disease process. Acute cardiac symptoms should be reviewed along with the use of antianginal therapy (nitroglycorin [NIG]) and how to contact emergency medical services. Families may be given education and resources on CPR and automated external defibrillator (AED) use. Patients should be advised to avoid potentially harmful medications (e.g., sildenafil while using nitrates).
G. Pharmacologic secondary prevention aims to modify the principal risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension, in conjunction with antiplatelet, antiarrhythmic (beta blockers), and antiischemic therapy.
H. Psychosocial assessment should include evaluation for symptoms of depression or anxiety related to or contributing to the patient's symptoms with appropriate therapy when indicated. Coping mechanisms should be assessed, and referral for counseling should be made when indicated. In the case of patients with overall poor prognosis, discussion regarding values and overall goals of care is important.
I. Behavioral counseling is a critical intervention for secondary prevention and should be addressed at each office visit, including dietary/weight loss strategies, smoking cessation, and exercise. A low-fat and low-cholesterol diet is recommended as specified per
