Unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarctions (NSTEMI) most commonly arise from nearly
complete but not total occlusion of a coronary artery with
a platelet- and fibrin-rich thrombus. Patients presenting
with UA/NSTEMI represent a heterogeneous population,
with the rate of death and recurrent myocardial infarction
at 1 year ranging from <5% in patients at low risk to >20%
in the patients at highest risk. The therapeutic options for
patients with UA/NSTEMI have continued to increase to
include more varied and potent antiplatelet and antithrom-
botic agents and improved percutaneous coronary inter-
ventional techniques. Thus, the clinician has many treat-
ment options available and must effectively discriminate
which patients are likely to benefit from the most aggres-
sive treatment while balancing the risk of potential side ef-
fects or complications in those at lower risk. Effective risk
stratification is critical to making appropriate decisions for
therapeutic care.
A. The decision to hospitalize a patient with ischemic
symptoms relies on a careful history, physical examina-
tion, a resting 12-lead ECG, and laboratory test for
cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB [CKMB] or
cardiac-specific troponins). Patients with intermediate
to high likelihood of true ischemic disease should be
hospitalized, whereas those without any of these fea-
tures may be evaluated in an observation unit or as an
outpatient.
B. Determining appropriate therapy for each patient
admitted with presumed UA/NSTEMI requires an
assessment of their clinical risk of recurrent ischemic
events and death. Three easily obtained indicators of
high risk for recurrent ischemic events—elevated levels
of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin), ST-segment devia-
tion, and high clinical risk scores—identify those patients
who are at highest risk and warrant the most aggressive
medical and invasive therapy. One widely used clinical
risk score is the TIMI Risk Score, which incorporates
seven easily obtained clinical characteristics.
C. Patients with no ECG changes, normal levels of cardiac
biomarkers, and low clinical risk factors can be managed
conservatively with aspirin, heparin (unfractionated or
low molecular weight heparin [UFH/LMWH]), beta
blockers, clopidogrel, and nitrates as needed. If they do
not develop recurrent ischemia or other clinical instabil-
ity, they should undergo a stress test for further risk
stratification.
D. Clinical trial evidence supports the use of more aggres-
sive medical and invasive therapy in patients who are
found to be at increased risk for death or recurrent
ischemia. The benefit of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibi-
tors and an early invasive catheterization has been
shown to be most beneficial in reducing both death and
recurrent MI in patients with positive cardiac biomark-
ers, ST-segment changes, or a TIMI Risk Score ≥3.
E. Any patient who has recurrent ischemia, hemodynamic
compromise or congestive heart failure (CHF), serious
ventricular arrhythmia, reduced left ventricular function
(ejection fraction <40%), or a strongly positive stress
test should be considered for catheterization regardless
of initial management strategy.
F. Long-term therapy for any patient with UA/NSTEMI
includes risk factor modification together with aspirin,
clopidogrel, beta blockers, high-dose statins, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
