A. Heartburn is the leading symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is a substernal sensation of burning that radiates orad and usually reflects the presence of gastric content in the esophagus.
B. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is the most effective kind of therapy to relieve symptoms of GERD. At the same time PPI therapy is effective in healing the erosive esophagitis that occurs in a minority of patients who present with heartburn.
C. Step-down treatment is a way to define the lowest level of therapy that will provide symptom relief for a patient. The dose of PPI maybe reduced to every other day, or an H2-receptor antagonist may be initiated.
D. The alarm symptoms and signs of GERD include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), weight loss, and anemia. These findings warrant immediate endoscopy to look for complications that need prompt attention, such as esophageal stricture, esophageal ulcer, and cancer.
E. Most patients with GERD have satisfactory symptom control with PPI therapy; a subgroup require twice-daily dosing.
F. Maintenance PPI therapy is whatever dose of PPI that controls the patient's symptoms. It is often necessary to maintain a PPI indefinitely in order to control the symptoms and mucosal disease of the patient with GERD. It is important to recognize that the contemporary indication for laparoscopic fundoplication is not the failure of medical therapy but rather the symptomatic response of the patient to a PPI. Patients who are maintained on a PPI with relief but who still have residual regurgitation indicating volume reflux are appropriate candidates for laparoscopic fundoplication.
G. Initiate 24-hour pH monitoring for patients who fail PPI twice-daily therapy. The goal is to see if there is still abnormal distal esophagus acid exposure. The majority of patients will in fact have a normal 24-hour pH study. However, if the duration of low pH in the distal esophagus is still elevated, an increased dosing of the PPI is appropriate.
H. Upper endoscopy is a consideration in any patient with chronic heartburn. Even if the patient's symptoms are controlled with a PPI, the duration of heartburn should be counted from the onset of reflux symptoms through the course of PPI therapy. Patients most likely to have Barrett's esophagus, according to our current understanding, include older white males with chronic reflux. Unfortunately, we now recognize that a significant group of patients with Barrett's esophagus lack reflux symptoms.
