**BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY**

A. The most common presentation for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is obstructive and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Irritative symptoms of LUTS include frequency, nocturia, and urgency; obstructive symptoms of LUTS include hesitancy, incomplete bladder emptying, straining, weak stream, and dribbling. Assessment of LUTS begins with a focused history and physical examination, including onset and duration of urinary symptoms, medical and surgical history, sexual history, neurologic history, and rectal examination. The differential diagnosis includes BPH, prostate cancer, urinary tract infection (UTI), bladder cancer, bladder or ureteral calculi, urethral stricture, cystitis, prostatitis, polyuria, colovesical fistula, and neurogenic bladder.
B. Patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >4.0 ng/ml, PSA velocity >0.75 ng/ml per year, or prostatic nodule palpated on rectal examination should undergo a prostate biopsy to assess for prostate cancer. When assessing risk for prostate cancer in patients who take 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, double the serum PSA value. PSA may be transiently elevated with prostatitis, UTI, ejaculation, urethral instrumentation, rectal manipulation, or extensive physical activity.
C. Irritative urinary symptoms with microhematuria warrant workup for ureteral calculi, bladder calculi, and malignancy of the urinary tract. Significant hematuria is defined as 3 RBCs per high-power field (hpf) on two of three voided urine specimens, >100 RBCs/hpf on any urinary specimen, or gross hematuria. Urine cytology is a useful screening tool for high-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary tract: negative or atypical cytology is considered negative for TCC; suspicious or TCC cytology is considered positive for TCC.
D. Use the American Urological Association Symptom Score and Quality of Life Questionnaire (AUASS/QOL) for a subjective measure of LUTS attributable to BPH. The AUASS/QOL is a validated questionnaire that quantifies common symptoms of LUTS, including incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, hesitancy, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia, and an overall bother score from voiding symptoms. AUASS/QOL ≤7 indicates mild or nonbothersome symptoms; AUASS/QOL≥8 indicates moderate/severe or bothersome symptoms. Objective measures for BPH include postvoid residual (PVR) volume, uroflowmetry, and urodynamics. In patients with normal bladder function, PVR >50 cc or urine flow <10 cc/sec suggest lower urinary tract obstruction.


**PROSTATITIS**

A. Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland that encompasses a spectrum of clinical disease. The most common presentation is recurrent dysuria with irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms in the absence of bacterial infection. Specific complaints may include perineal pain, low back pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, straining, weak stream, hesitancy, and a sense of incomplete bladder emptying. The differential diagnosis for prostatitis includes sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infections, genitourinary malignancy, urolithiasis, urethral stricture, and neurogenic bladder. Workup for all cases of prostatitis begins with a focused history and physical examination, including sexual history, urinalysis, and urine culture. Based on a patient's risk factors, further studies may include urethral cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia, testing for herpes and HIV, serum creatinine, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), postvoid residual recording, voided urine cytology, CT scan, cystoscopy, transrectal ultrasound of the prostate (TRUS), and urodynamics.
B. Hematuria warrants workup for urolithiasis, genitourinary malignancy, and urinary tract infection. Significant hematuria is defined as ≥3 RBCs per high-power field (hpf) on two of three voided urine specimens, >100 RBCs/hpf on any urinary specimen, or gross hematuria.
C. Acute bacterial prostatitis, a bacterial infection of the prostate of sudden onset, represents 2%–5% of prostatitis cases. Typically, patients are sexually active men <35 years, presenting with perineal or suprapubic pain, urethral discharge, obstructive urinary symptoms, and systemic signs of infection. Transmission can be sexual from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis or by direct extension of Escherichia coli from the lower urinary tract or rectum.
D. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, a recurrent or persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, represents 2%–5% of prostatitis cases. Typically, patients are older men, presenting with intermittent and milder symptoms of dysuria than those with acute bacterial prostatitis. On examination, the prostate is tender and boggy with suprapubic tenderness during acute episodes of prostatitis. The most common causative organism is E. coli; other organisms include Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Start empiric treatment with 8–16 weeks of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP) or quinolone antibiotics. Symptomatic control may be achieved with alpha blockers, anticholinergics, NSAIDs, and sitz baths. Consider surgical management with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in men with prostate calculi, prostatic abscess, or persistent prostatitis after extensive medical management.
E. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome represents 90%-95% of prostatitis cases and is a diagnosis of exclusion. This syndrome is defined as genitourinary pain in the absence of identifiable infection, malignancy, urethral structure, and neurologic dysfunction. Proposed mechanisms include nonbacterial infection, reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts, and autoimmune disease. Possible infectious agents include Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Empiric treatment begins with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or quinolone antibiotics for 6–8 weeks. If there is no response, consider 4–6 weeks of doxycycline or metronidazole. For severe symptoms, patients can be started with some combination of alpha blockers, anticholinergics, narcotics, NSAIDs, tricyclics, and allopurinol. Other supportive measures include sitz baths, avoidance of alcohol and caffeine, prostatic message, pelvic floor exercises, stress reduction, and biofeedback.
