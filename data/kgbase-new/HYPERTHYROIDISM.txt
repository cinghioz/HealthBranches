Hyperthyroidism can be caused by an increased production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves' disease or an autonomous nodule) or increased release of preformed thyroid hormone (as in thyroiditis). Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by overreplacement with exogenous thyroid hormone, ectopic hyperthyroidism, or unregulated stimulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (as in trophoblastic disease or a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma).

A. The presentation of hyperthyroidism can range from asymptomatic to thyroid storm. In particular, the presentation in older patients can be highly variable. Characteristic symptoms include anxiety, tremor, palpitations, heat intolerance, insomnia, oligoamenorrhea, and weight loss despite an increased appetite. Typical signs include tachycardia, systolic hypertension, tremor, lid retraction, lid lag, warm skin, and hyperreflexia. The presence of a goiter will depend on the cause of the hyperthyroidism. A single palpable nodule or multiple nodules suggest an autonomous thyroid adenoma or a multinodular goiter as the source, respectively; a painful, tender thyroid gland suggests granulomatous thyroiditis. Signs that are suggestive of Graves' disease include goiter, thyroid bruit, exophthalmos, periorbital edema, and pretibial myxedema.
B. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed using biochemical testing of the thyroxine and TSH levels. An increased thyroxine level with a suppressed TSH level characterizes overt hyperthyroidism. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have a normal thyroxine level and a suppressed TSH level. Some patients demonstrate T3 toxicosis with a normal thyroxine level and an elevated level of triiodothyronine. TSH-induced hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone resistance, each characterized by an increased level of TSH, are very rare. An elevated thyroxine with a normal TSH level is usually attributed to abnormalities in thyroid-binding proteins in patients who are clinically euthyroid.
C. When the etiology of the hyperthyroidism is unclear, a thyroid radioiodine uptake study can be performed. Graves' disease is characterized by a high uptake; thyroiditis is characterized by a low uptake.
D. Propylthiouracil and methimazole are the antithyroid medications used in the United States. These agents are actively concentrated by the thyroid gland and their primary effect is to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with thyroid peroxidase-mediated iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, a critical step in the synthesis of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Propylthiouracil also blocks the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine within the thyroid and peripheral tissues, although the clinical importance of this function is uncertain. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal or liver failure or among children or the elderly.
E. Cutaneous reactions to antithyroid drugs are not uncommon and are usually mild. The drug should be stopped in patients with arthralgias because this may be a presentation of a severe transient migratory polyarthritis associated with antithyroid drug use. Agranulocytosis, the most feared side effect, occurs in approximately 1 in 270 patients prescribed antithyroid medications. A baseline differential white cell count should be obtained before treatment is restarted, and retesting should be done if fever or sore throat develops. The medication should be discontinued if the granulocyte count is <1000 per cubic millimeter. Hepatotoxicity and vasculitis (drug-induced lupus) are rare but well described.
F. Current treatments for Graves' disease include antithyroid medications, radioiodine, and surgery. Initial treatment usually includes an antithyroid medication and a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. A typical starting combination would include methimazole 20 mg with atenolol 25 mg, both given once daily. For patients with more severe hyperthyroidism, iodine treatment can provide rapid relief of symptoms. A typical approach would be to prescribe 3 drops of saturated solution of potassium iodide 3 times daily for up to 10 days. Radioiodine can be given as primary treatment for patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, although many clinicians will wait until the first relapse before offering this approach. Hyperthyroidism can be exacerbated for a short time by radioiodine treatment. In patients with cardiac disease or in the elderly, in whom such an exacerbation would be risky, pretreatment with antithyroid medications can be useful. Surgery is usually reserved for patients with an obstructing goiter. Hyperthyroidism associated with a toxic thyroid adenoma can be treated with antithyroid medications and a beta blocker. Because these autonomous nodules do not resolve spontaneously, more definitive treatment is usually indicated after the initial symptoms have been controlled. Radioiodine is a preferred over surgery for most patients but is less likely to be effective in patients with large or multiple nodules.
G. Women who develop hyperthyroidism while pregnant are at increased risk of spontaneous abortion, premature labor, stillbirth, and preeclampsia. Changes in thyroid hormone-binding globulin (usually doubles), levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (that can mimic the actions of TSH), and endogenous physiology (altered TSH responsiveness) can complicate the biochemical assessment of thyroid function in pregnancy. Because radioiodine is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy, antithyroid medications are the preferred treatment for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism. Propylthiouracil remains the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism occurring during pregnancy. The dose should be minimized to prevent fetal hypothyroidism because the drug does cross the placenta. Methimazole may be associated with congenital anomalies, including aplasia cutis and choanal or esophageal atresia. Generally treatment is given to a point where mild hyperthyroidism is allowed to persist. Low thyroid function at birth is found in approximately half of neonates whose mothers received an antithyroid medication; ultimate intelligence has been demonstrated to be normal. Both methimazole and propylthiouracil are approved for nursing mothers by the American Academy of Pediatrics, although they do appear in breast milk in minute quantities.
