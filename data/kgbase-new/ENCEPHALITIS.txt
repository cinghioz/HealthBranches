Encephalitis should be suspected in patients with acute or subacute presentations of altered levels of consciousness, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, or new psychiatric illness associated with fever and headache. Encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis, is most commonly caused by viral infection but also may be secondary to other infectious agents, malignancy, or autoimmune processes. The differential diagnosis includes isolated meningitis, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, brain abscess or malignancy, vasculitis, and systemic infection.
A. Define all neurologic deficits, including presence of meningismus and their duration (acute, lasting hours to days, and subacute, present for weeks). Identify a past medical history of HIV or immunosuppression and travel, animal and insect exposure, sick contact, vaccine, and sexual history. List all medications and illicit drugs. In addition to a detailed neurologic examination, assess for papilledema and unusual rashes.
B. Evaluate for decompensated renal or liver failure, drug intoxication, or systemic infection. Although these findings may provide an alternative diagnosis, they do not preclude thorough evaluation for encephalitis. HIV testing should be performed for subacute presentations.
