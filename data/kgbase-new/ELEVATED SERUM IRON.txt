A. Amylase is an enzyme with a 55,000-dalton molecular weight that hydrolyzes starch. The pancreas and salivary glands contain very high concentrations of amylase. Amylase also is produced by a number of other organs in lower concentrations. Approximately 35%-45% of normal serum amylase is of pancreatic origin. Amylase has a serum half-life of 1-2 hours. Approximately 20% of circulating amylase is excreted in the urine; the remainder is catabolized at an unknown site. Increased serum amylase is most commonly caused by pancreatitis, but hyperamylasemia may be associated with several other nonpancreatic or nonabdominal disorders with similar clinical presentations.
B. In acute pancreatitis serum amylase increases within 24-48 hours of the acute onset of pancreatitis. Levels return to normal within 3–5 days in most cases. A normal serum amylase level occasionally is seen in acute pancreatitis. This may represent early pancreatitis, after a transient rise and fall of amylase, extensive pancreatic necrosis with inability to produce amylase, or cases of acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis in which the gland cannot produce amylase. Serum amylase also may be normal when pancreatitis is associated with hypertriglyceridemia. In this case, a urinary amylase measurement usually shows a marked elevation. Cholelithiasis, ethanol, and idiopathic causes are responsible for about 90% of all cases of acute pancreatitis. Commonly used drugs known to cause pancreatitis include ethanol, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, estrogens, valproate, and azathioprine. A serum amylase level >3 times the upper limit of normal is consistent with pancreatitis. Other abdominal processes usually do not cause amylase levels >2–2.5 times the upper limit of normal, with the exception of salivary gland disease and gut perforation or infarction.
C. In acute pancreatitis with persistent elevated serum amylase levels, complications of acute pancreatitis as listed should be considered. Abdominal CT is useful in identifying pseudocysts, abscesses, ascites, and some tumors: Consider MRI of the pancreas with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or consider endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in pancreatitis of biliary origin or idiopathic pancreatitis. This would be of low yield if the CT, MRI, MRCP, and EUS results are negative.
D. In a patient with epigastric pain and elevated serum amylase, rule out causes other than acute pancreatitis. In cases of perforated viscus (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon), peritoneal absorption of GI contents results in elevated serum amylase. The patient usually has a more abrupt onset of pain and more peritoneal irritation. Several other nonpancreatic conditions listed also present with more pronounced signs of peritonitis, and most need surgical intervention.
E. The elevation of serum amylase in renal insufficiency usually is modest, seldom >2 times the upper limit of normal. Macroamylasemia is a condition in which the major portion of serum amylase is bound to immunoglobulin A (IgA). These macromolecular aggregates cannot undergo glomerular filtration, so the urine amylase level is low or normal. The amylase/creatinine clearance ratio (ACR) is calculated as follows: ACR = A (urine) × CR (serum) / A (serum) × CR (urine) × 100 where A = amylase concentration and CR = creatinine concentration. In macroamylasemia, the ACR is abnormally low (usually <0.2%).
F. After the common causes have been considered, more obscure causes should be sought. Isoamylase or lipase measurements may be helpful. Elevated serum amylase secondary to lung disease or certain tumors is commonly of the salivary or s-isoenzyme. Alcoholic patients may have an elevated serum amylase of salivary origin.
