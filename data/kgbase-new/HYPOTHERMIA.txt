The most common presentation of hypothermia is accidental. A few deaths each year from hypothermia are attributed to homicide and suicide. By definition, hypothermia is a core temperature <35Â° C, yet patients with the same core temperature may manifest signs and symptoms of hypothermia very differently. The most important variables influencing the outcome of patients with hypothermia are age, comorbidities, duration of cold exposure, nutritional status, medication use, or intoxicant use. Accidental hypothermia usually occurs when the normal compensatory mechanisms to heat loss are overwhelmed by exposure. When a patient has impaired compensatory mechanisms, hypothermia is more severe and likely to be fatal.
Initial therapy is directed at treating the underlying cause of the hypothermia and passive and active rewarming. It is important to recognize that hypothermia may be a manifestation of severe systemic disease, such as sepsis, stroke, cardiovascular accident, acute coronary syndrome, or myxedema coma.
