A. The first step in any assessment is to take a comprehensive history with a focus on the exposure to asbestos. In the United States, the majority of exposure was to chrysolite, a serpentine fiber, which is thought to be less likely to cause disease. In contrast, the long rodlike fibers of amphibole asbestos (e.g., crocidolite, amosite, and tremolite) were much less commonly used. Specific occupations with the potential for high exposure to asbestos include plumbers, pipe fitters, insulation workers, electricians, boilermakers, and obviously those who worked mining asbestos. Shipyards, particularly in the 1940s, were a common place for occupational exposure. More recently, mechanics who specifically work on brakes are at risk for exposure to the asbestos found in brake linings. For the most part, symptomatic lung disease related to asbestos exposure manifests itself 15-20 years after the exposure. If symptoms occur much closer temporally to an exposure, the differential for the cause of dyspnea should be broadened.
B. A complete physical examination with particular emphasis on the lung examination should accompany history taking. The finding of crackles, decreased breath sounds, or dullness to percussion may suggest specific pathologies. In almost all cases, the next step should be a chest x-ray (CXR). Further evaluation is guided by what is found on imaging.
C. The most common finding in patients with asbestos exposure is pleural plaquesâ€”areas of pleural thickening and calcification. Plaques themselves are generally benign, although they may be seen in conjunction with other forms of asbestos-related lung disease. The clinician should obtain lung volumes to evaluate for restrictive physiology (total lung capacity <70% predicted) as a result of pleural disease if the patient presents with dyspnea. As plaques are associated with future asbestosis, these patients should be followed and monitored for future fibrosis.
D. Distinct from the parietal pleural plaques and much less common is diffuse visceral pleural thickening associated with asbestos exposure. This pathology is much more likely to result in restrictive physiology, which should be evaluated for with pulmonary function testing.
E. Although the majority of findings associated with asbestos are found many years after exposure, pleural effusions can be found after an acute exposure and more remotely. These effusions are exudative, often with a prominent eosinophilia. Although generally painless and often found incidentally, an acute asbestos pleural effusion may be painful and associated with fever and dyspnea. All of these effusions should be tapped. Chronic effusions warrant cytologic examination for malignancy and if there are any concerning features (e.g., loculation, associated irregular pleural thickening), a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy should be considered.
F. Malignant mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos; approximately 70% of patients with this disease have a known exposure. It is often difficult to diagnose and commonly requires pleural biopsy. Although in the past this may be have been done with needle biopsy, as the yield of this procedure is quite low, patients generally should proceed to thoracoscopic biopsy if pleural fluid cytology is unrevealing. Unfortunately, both surgical and chemotherapeutic options for mesothelioma are of limited benefit. Physicians should consider referral to a center that specializes in treatment of these rare cancers.
G. If the CXR reveals reticulonodular changes, the physician should have concern for asbestosis, which is often difficult to distinguish from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Features that help distinguish these two diseases are a history of exposure to asbestos and associated pleural plaques. Although both diseases are generally lower lobe predominant, there is a subtype of asbestosis that is severe, upper lobe disease. Next steps in assessment include lung volumes and measurement of carbon dioxide diffusion in the lungs (DLco) to assess for restrictive physiology and abnormal gas exchange in addition to a CT scan of the chest to better characterize the infiltrates. A clinical diagnosis is usually made without the need for a lung biopsy, although at times this is undertaken to rule out alternative diagnoses. The finding of asbestos fibers or asbestos bodies adds to the diagnostic certainty but is not required and in itself is not pathognomonic of asbestosis. There is no specific therapy for asbestosis and care is generally supportive.
H. Cigarette smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect in increasing the risk for primary lung cancer. If a mass is found on CXR, a CT scan should be obtained and further evaluation, as with any lung mass, should be pursued.
