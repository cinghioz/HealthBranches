One must ensure that the dilated pupil is the abnormal pupil by examining the patient in both bright and dim ambient light. If the anisocoria is greater in bright lighting and the larger pupil constricts poorly to penlight examination, then the dilated pupil is the abnormal pupil.
Physiologic anisocoria occurs in approximately 20% of the population. It is characterized by anisocoria that is similar in both bright and dark, normal pupillary constriction to light, and anisocoria that is usually <1 mm in diameter.
A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by acute pain with blurred vision and colored halos around lights. On examination, the pupil is unreactive and fixed in a mid-dilated position. The conjunctiva is typically hyperemic, with corneal edema demonstrated by a dulled reflection of light from the corneal surface. The intraocular pressure is acutely elevated. This is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent visual loss. If a Tonopen is available to confirm acutely elevated intraocular pressure, Timoptic 0.5% 1 gtt and/or Diamox 500 mg PO/IV should be given. The patient should be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist for definitive management.
B. In a patient with a dilated pupil, an extraocular motility deficit with or without associated ptosis indicates a third nerve palsy until proved otherwise. The patient may have periorbital pain or headache. Immediate neuroimaging should be obtained, with MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium to rule out an aneurysm or mass.
C. Unilateral or asymmetric exposure to adrenergic agents will cause mydriasis associated with a widened palpebral fissure and blanched conjunctiva resulting from vasoconstriction. Common agents include over-the-counter vasoconstrictors for “red eyes” and adrenergic glaucoma medications. Accommodation remains unaffected.
D. Parasympathetic blockade of pupillary constriction typically results in a very large pupil and is associated with loss of accommodation. Common causative agents include atropine, scopolamine patch, and night-blooming flowers.
E. Surgery, prior ocular trauma, or prior inflammation may cause a dilated pupil that may have irregular margins.
F. An Adie's tonic pupil demonstrates cholinergic supersensitivity; the dilated pupil constricts significantly more than the contralateral pupil in response to dilute pilocarpine (0.125%). Additional signs seen without pharmacologic intervention include: (1) The affected pupil constricts slowly in response to light, but constricts quickly with accommodation (looking at a near target. It also remains tonic (redilates slowly) after a prolonged accomodative effort. (2) Segmental palsy of the iris sphincter, seen as an irregularly constricting pupil margin.
