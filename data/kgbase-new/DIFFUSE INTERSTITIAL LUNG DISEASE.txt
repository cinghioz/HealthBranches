Diffuse interstitial lung disease (ILD) constitutes a broad variety of disease. Diagnosis can be a challenge, and in some cases surgical lung biopsy will ultimately be required. Treatment can also be challenging because of a lack of effective therapy for many of these diseases. A comprehensive guide to treatment of these diseases is outside the scope of this algorithm, which provides a general approach to diagnosis and treatment.

A. A comprehensive history is the first step in characterizing diffuse ILD. Initial questions should include a determination of the extent of the patient's dyspnea with particular emphasis on overall functional status and the impact of dyspnea on activities of daily living. Review the tempo and timing of the progression of symptoms, including dyspnea and cough. The presence of hemoptysis will guide further diagnostic evaluation. Because many interstitial lung diseases are related to collagen vascular diseases, a rheumatologic review of systems can be useful. Assess environmental exposures, including home and workplace. Because there are links between smoking and a variety of medications with ILD, review both of these histories. Include a family history because some ILDs have a genetic component.
B. The physical examination should include the patient's respiratory rate and observation for signs of respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation, at rest and with ambulation, should be measured. Classic pulmonary findings of diffuse ILD include bibasilar “Velcro-like” crackles, particularly in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Other diseases, such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), may present with diffuse crackles, inspiratory squeaks and pops, and wheezes. Hypoxia can lead to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, which can result in an accentuated P2 heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure, and peripheral edema. A murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and fixed splitting of the second heart sound (as a result of the inability to decrease intrathoracic pressure during inspiration because of persistently elevated right-sided heart pressures) may be noted. Other peripheral signs may include clubbing and signs of rheumatologic disease, such as joint swelling or tight skin.
C. Laboratory values should include a CBC with differential (to look for signs of infection, eosinophilia, and anemia). Consider an ESR, ANA, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, and possibly other rheumatologic laboratory tests based on suspicion of a specific illness. Antibodies for detection of hypersensitivity pneumonitis to environmental allergens should be sent if this is suspected. Peripheral blood eosinophilia (>1 × 10º eosinophils) should raise the question of an eosinophilic pneumonia. For suspected sarcoidosis, a serum calcium level and angiotensin-converting enzyme level may be checked, although neither is diagnostic.
D. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be obtained and often show a restrictive deficit as manifest by a decreased total lung capacity (TLC <80% predicted). Certain diffuse ILDs, such as pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (PLCH), lymphomatoid granulomatosis, or sarcoidosis, may also have an obstructive component. It is often useful to have baseline lung function tests prior to beginning treatment to be able to monitor response to therapy.
E. A chest x-ray (CXR) should be obtained on all patients with suspected ILD. Historically, the sensitivity of a CXR to diagnose chronic diffuse ILD has been considered to be around 90%. The sensitivity of modern chest radiograph machines to diagnose chronic diffuse ILD may be even higher.
F. A normal CXR in a patient suspected of having disease should prompt a chest CT scan with high-resolution thin sections to allow for the greatest ability to diagnose early ILD. Signs of diffuse ILD on CXR should also be evaluated with CT scan to better characterize the disease process.
G. If the disease process is thought secondary to an environmental exposure or drug, eliminate the inciting agent. Depending on the time course of the disease, observation for clinical resolution of the disease process may be acceptable before proceeding to more invasive means of diagnosis.
H. A characteristic CT scan pattern and supporting clinical information may be sufficient to be diagnostic. The presence of honeycombing with basal and peripheral predominance is considered by some to be sufficient evidence for a diagnosis of IPF, whereas others believe that biopsy is required for diagnostic certainty. Other diseases with characteristic radiographic patterns, such as PLCH or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), may also be diagnosed radiographically when patient history is also consistent with the disease process and when biopsy may be difficult.
I. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) alone may allow for a diagnosis in some of the diffuse ILDs. It should be performed in cases of suspected infection such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or in suspected cases of eosinophilic Pneumonia. A finding of >25% eosinophils on BAL is generally considered consistent with acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), whereas >40% eosinophils is indicative of a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). BAL should be performed in suspected cases of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Multiple lavage specimens in which bloody aspirate fails to clear and hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen are characteristic of DAH. BAL may also be helpful in a variety of rarer diseases. These include PLCH (to look for >5% CDal+ cells), chronic beryllium disease (CBD; to send cells from BAL for a beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test), and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP; to look for milky fluid and periodic acid-Schiff positive fluid.
J. Transbronchial biopsy performed via a flexible bronchoscope may be the diagnostic procedure of choice for a few ILDs. For suspected sarcoidosis, taking a minimum of four biopsies provides a sensitivity of >90%. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of lymph nodes via bronchoscopy may also be helpful in making this diagnosis. Lymphangitic spread of cancer and hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy. However, for most ILDs, diagnostic yield is often low and many clinicians would recommend proceeding directly to surgical biopsy.
K. For suspected disease processes in which less invasive studies have been unrevealing or are thought unlikely to reveal a diagnosis, surgical biopsy may be indicated. Surgical biopsy is now most often performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) biopsy. This form of biopsy is performed through three small incisions and is generally well tolerated. A chest tube is usually maintained for 1–2 days following the procedure with a short period of hospitalization. Mediastinoscopy should be performed if lymph nodes are enlarged. Open lung biopsy may occasionally be necessary based on the distribution of the disease process. The decision of which route of biopsy to pursue should be undertaken after thoughtful discussion with specialists and with the patient. Further therapy is then guided by the results of the biopsy.
