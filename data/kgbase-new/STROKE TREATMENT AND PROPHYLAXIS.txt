A. In patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who are candidates for anticoagulation, it is important to evaluate any evidence of cerebral hemorrhage to triage the possibility of thrombolysis or anticoagulation. The timing of the presentation of stroke is crucial for acute stroke therapy (see Acute Stroke chapter).
B. Beyond the acute phase, management of stroke and TIA centers around secondary prophylaxis. This management includes modification of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and obesity. Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common causes of death in patients with TIA; therefore, a thorough cardiac history and evaluation are indicated.
C. Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, aspirin plus dipyridamole, or clopidogrel) are the treatment of choice for noncardioembolic TIA or stroke of atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic etiology. Anticoagulant therapy (warfarin, bridged by low molecular weight heparin or IV heparin) is the mainstay medical therapy for the management of stroke related to atrial fibrillation. Consider anticoagulation also for patients with a thrombus, mechanical prosthetic valve, or carotid/vertebral dissection. However, because of the hemorrhagic risks, anticoagulation is a relative contraindication for embolic stroke from endocarditis. Clinical suspicion of endocarditis would warrant the withholding of anticoagulation therapy.
D. For noncardioembolic stroke, the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest use of either aspirin-dipyridamole or clopidogrel over aspirin, if there is no added financial strain to the patient. The risk of agranulocytosis makes ticlopidine a second-line antiplatelet agent for those who do not tolerate first-line agents. CBC must be checked every 2 weeks for the first 3 months.
E. Management of carotid artery TIAs involves the determination of the degree of carotid stenosis. If there is an ipsilateral stenosis of â‰¥70%, carotid endarterectomy along with best medical treatment (antiplatelet agent or anticoagulation) is more beneficial than medical therapy alone. Stent placement or angioplasty are still under investigation but may offer a better risk/benefit profile in selected higher-risk patient populations.
