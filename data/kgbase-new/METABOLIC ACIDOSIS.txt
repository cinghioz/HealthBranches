A. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in the serum bicarbonate concentration, which is a result of depletion of bicarbonate or by endogenous consumption of bicarbonate to buffer exogenous or endogenous generation of acid. Metabolic acidosis can be subdivided into elevated anion gap (AG) or normal AG acidosis (Table 1). Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a classical cause for a normal AG metabolic acidosis (Table 2). In proximal RTA the primary defect is impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate by the proximal tubule. It frequently is associated with defective phosphate, glucose, urate, and amino acid resorption. With distal RTA, the primary defect is an inability to maximally acidify the urine. Type III RTA is a combination of type I and type II RTA. Type IV RTA is characterized by impaired urinary acidification because of hypoaldosteronism. An elevated AG acidosis may occur commonly as a complication of a systemic illness. The AG is equal to the difference between the plasma concentrations of the measured plasma cation (i.e., Na+) and the measured anions (i.e., chloride [Cl-], HCO3). AG calculation = (Na+) - ([Cl-] + [HCO3¯]). The normal AG is 8-16 mEq/L, with an average value of 12. Causes of a high AG, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and ingestions are salicylate, methanol or formaldehyde (formate), ethylene glycol (glycolate, oxalate), paraldehyde (organic anions), sulfur (SO4¯), phenformin/metformin, and pyroglutamic acidemia (5-oxoprolinemia). The mnemonic MUDPILES is popular: M-methanol; U-uremia; D—diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA),AKA;P—paraldehyde, phenformin; I-iron, isoniazid; L-lactic (i.e., CO, cyanide); E-ethylene glycol; and S—salicylates.
B. The clinical features of metabolic acidosis are nonspecific. The most common manifestation is hyperventilation because the respiratory center in the brainstem is stimulated to compensate for the acidosis. At its most severe, patients report air hunger. Severe metabolic acidosis may also be associated with hemodynamic instability—a problem most frequently encountered in the intensive care unit. Other manifestations of metabolic acidosis reflect the underlying cause or trigger (e.g., diarrhea, DKA, drug ingestion). The diagnostic approach pivots on the measurement of serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and an ABG level. A low serum HCO3 and a pH <7.40 on ABG analysis confirm metabolic acidosis. The AG should be calculated to help with the differential diagnosis of the metabolic acidosis and to diagnose mixed disorders. A high-AG acidosis is present if the AG is >10–12 mEq/L, and a non-AG acidosis is present if the AG is <10-12 mEq/L. If the AG is elevated, the osmolar gap should be calculated by subtracting the calculated serum osmolality from the measured serum osmolality. (Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning increase the AG and the osmolar gap.) In the case of an increased AG, the ratio of AG and HCO3 should be calculated (Δ:Δ). Α Δ:Δ <1 suggests mixed normal-AG and high-AG acidosis; an Δ:Δ >2 suggests coexisting metabolic alkalosis. Increases in AG may be observed in nonacidotic states, such as metabolic alkalosis and respiratory alkalosis; however, increases in AG beyond 3–5 mEq/L are unusual. Assessment of the urinary anion gap (UAG) can also be helpful in diagnosis. The urine anion gap (UAG) = (UNa + UK) - Ucl. The UAG is normally positive (range: 30–50). A negative UAG suggests renal excretion of unmeasured cation (e.g., NH4+; an extra-renal acidosis). A positive UAG suggests minimal renal excretion of unmeasured cation (e.g., NH4+). Causes include proximal RTA type II, distal RTA or type I, or type IV RTA. Other tests can be performed, including a screen for toxins (e.g., ethylene glycol, salicylate) and tests for metabolic disorders (e.g., ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis) that are known to elevate the AG.
C. Lactic acidosis can be classified as type A, which occurs as a consequence of tissue hypoxia from tissue hypoperfusion or reduced arterial oxygen content. The second category is type B, which does not reflect tissue hypoxia. The most common category is type B1-from sepsis, hepatic failure, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, cancer, malaria, or cholera. The second category is type B2 from drugs or toxins (e.g., acetaminophen, ethanol, salicylates, and ethylene glycol). The third category is type B3, reflecting strenuous muscular exercise, grand mal seizures, and D-lactic acidosis. The clinical presentation of lactic acidosis reflects the underlying etiology (e.g., sepsis or drug ingestion).
D. Treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause and the severity of manifestations. A general rule is that treatment should be initiated if the pH is <7.1, especially when associated with hemodynamic instability. In patients with chronic metabolic acidosis, such as a patient with RTA, oral repletion with sodium bicarbonate is usually sufficient. The HCO3¯ deficit can be calculated by using the following equation: HCO3¯ deficit = deficit/L (desired serum HCO3- measured HCO3¯) × 0.5 × body weight (volume of distribution for HCO3-). Sodium bicarbonate can be administered intravenously.
