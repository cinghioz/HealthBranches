A. Dyspepsia is defined as chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, mainly in or around the midline as opposed to the right or left hypochondrium (Rome II criteria). Discomfort is characterized by or associated with fullness, early satiety, bloating, or nausea. Dyspepsia may or may not be related to eating meals. The annual prevalence of recurrent dyspepsia is approximately 25% over a 3- to 12-month period. If frequent heartburn is included in dyspeptic symptoms, the prevalence exceeds 40%.
The physical examination is usually normal except for mild epigastric tenderness. Examination should assess for GI blood loss, jaundice, abdominal mass or organomegaly, and signs of malabsorption. Screening laboratory tests include CBC and general chemistries, including liver function tests and amylase. Additional studies may include stool inspection for parasites, abdominal radiography (for obstruction, calcifications), and gastroduodenal motility studies.
Dyspepsia can be caused by a number of disorders. Functional (idiopathic) dyspepsia, also referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, accounts for up to 60% of cases. Gastroduodenal ulcer disease is found in approximately 15%-25% of patients with dyspepsia but cannot be accurately distinguished from functional dyspepsia based on the symptom pattern. Atypical gastroesophageal reflux disease accounts for 5%-15% of cases. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is important to identify because the treatment of this disorder differs from the treatment of other causes of dyspepsia. Gastric or esophageal cancer is present in <2% of cases with dyspepsia. Biliary tract disease is a rare cause of chronic dyspepsia. Association between gallstones and dyspepsia should be made cautiously to avoid unnecessary cholecystectomy because gallstones may silently coexist in patients with dyspepsia.
B. NSAIDs can cause dyspepsia, and their use should be discontinued. Other medications that commonly cause dyspepsia include potassium supplements, iron, antibiotics (especially macrolides, sulfonamides, metronidazole), digitalis, corticosteroids, niacin, gemfibrozil, narcotics, colchicine, quinidine, estrogens, and theophylline.
C. Gastroesophageal malignancy is an uncommon cause of chronic dyspepsia. In addition to age older than 45-55 years, alarm symptoms such as weight loss, persistent vomiting, dysphagia, anemia, hematemesis, palpable abdominal mass, family history of upper GI carcinoma, and previous gastric surgery raise the suspicion of gastric malignancy and should lead to prompt endoscopy. Referral for upper endoscopy is always indicated in older patients presenting with new-onset dyspepsia.
D. It is recommended that young patients with dyspepsia without any alarm features undergo a noninvasive Helicobacter pylori test such as H. pylori breath or stool test. The rationale for testing for H. pylori in patients with dyspepsia is based on peptic ulcer disease as the etiology of a minority of cases of chronic dyspepsia. If H. pylori infection is present, then an empiric trial of H. pylori eradication treatment is recommended. A 2- to 4-week trial of an antisecretory agent is recommended for patients with negative H. pylori results. Endoscopy is recommended for all patients whose symptoms persist or who relapse after empirical therapy.
E. Patients who fail to respond to empiric therapeutic approaches should also undergo endoscopy. The majority of patients will be diagnosed as having functional dyspepsia. These patients may respond to reassurance and if necessary a course of antisecretory or prokinetic therapy. If symptoms persist, other treatments may include behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, or antidepressant therapy.
F. Functional dyspepsia, the most common type of dyspepsia encountered in clinical practice, is defined as follows: at least 12 weeks, which need not be consecutive, within the preceding 12 months of (1) persistent or recurrent dyspepsia (pain or discomfort and centered in the upper abdomen); (2) no evidence of organic disease (including upper GI endoscopic examination) that is likely to explain symptoms; and (3) no evidence that dyspepsia is exclusively relieved by defecation or associated with the onset of a change in stool frequency or stool form (i.e., not irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]).
