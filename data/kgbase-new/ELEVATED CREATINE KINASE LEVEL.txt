A. Measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is the most common laboratory test used in the evaluation of skeletal and cardiac muscle disease. It is also often part of routine panel testing and should be considered in the evaluation of elevated transaminases when hepatic causes are less likely. This chapter focuses on the evaluation of CK in the workup of musculoskeletal complaints.
B. The initial approach to an elevated CK is a detailed history and physical examination focusing on determining the origin of CK (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac, brain). This may be readily apparent, as in a patient with acute chest pain and changes on ECG or with severe proximal muscle weakness.
C. If the cause is not clinically evident, the CK isoenzyme CK-MB and troponins should be obtained to determine if the elevated CK is of cardiac origin. CK-MB can be mildly elevated secondary to regenerating skeletal muscle, and cardiac troponins can be elevated in patients with myocardial involvement of inflammatory myositis. If the CK elevation is of cardiac origin, immediately pursue the appropriate cardiac evaluation and therapy.
D. Occasionally elevated CK levels result from cerebral causes (i.e., trauma), which are usually readily apparent based on the clinical history.
E. If the CK elevation is from skeletal muscle, the history should focus on ruling out medications (cholesterol-lowering agents, colchicine, antimalarials, zidovudine), drugs and alcohol, trauma, vigorous exercise, dystrophinopathies, inflammatory myopathies, infectious myopathies, endocrinopathies, and iatrogenic causes (intramuscular injections, postoperative). The physical examination should include a complete neurologic evaluation and musculoskeletal examination, including muscle strength testing.
F. The laboratory evaluation consisting of a CBC, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests is important to evaluate the patient for hypothyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities, and infectious causes. These should guide subsequent evaluation and treatment.
G. If the history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation do not readily reveal a cause for the elevated CK, additional evaluation should be pursued. The role of skeletal muscle MRI is controversial and nonspecific but may be helpful to identify muscle groups for targeting biopsy. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are useful to distinguish myopathic and neuropathic alterations. Unilateral EMG/NCS should be obtained, preserving the contralateral side for muscle biopsy.
H. If the EMG is completely normal, the patient may be followed closely. However, one must consider false-negative EMG results if clinical suspicion for an underlying disorder persists. Additional laboratory tests, ANA, rheumatoid factor, and myositis-specific antibodies (anti-Jo-1, anti-Mi-2, and antisignal recognition peptide) may be helpful. If the CK elevation persists or progresses, MRI and/or muscle biopsy should be considered.
I. If the EMG demonstrates myopathic changes, a muscle biopsy should be obtained to determine the underlying pathology. If the EMG demonstrates neuropathic changes, consider additional neurologic evaluation.
J. A muscle biopsy should be performed on clinically involved muscle on the contralateral side of the EMG to avoid possible artifact in the biopsy from the EMG needle. Routine histochemical analysis of biopsy may be sufficient to make a diagnosis, but special analysis is often necessary and should be obtained after discussion with the pathologist. If inclusion body myositis is suspected, the biopsy should be processed for electron microscopy.
K. If the muscle biopsy is normal, the patient may be followed closely. However, many muscle diseases are patchy, and a single biopsy may not detect the involved site. Therefore, if symptoms persist, a repeat muscle biopsy or MRI may be required. If symptoms progress, empiric therapy may be done but with caution.
L. If the muscle biopsy is consistent with an inflammatory myopathy, treatment of polymyositis or dermatomyositis consists of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. Patients with dermatomyositis should be evaluated for an underlying malignancy. Patients should also be evaluated for a possible connective tissue disease (CTD), including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma.
M. The diagnosis of inherited and congenital myopathies often requires special tests on the muscle biopsy. Treatment is usually symptomatic. The patient should be evaluated by a neuromuscular specialist.
