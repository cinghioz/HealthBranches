A. Diarrhea is one of the most common complaints resulting in visits to a physician. The history and physical examination (including rectal examination) are critical in determining who needs further diagnostic evaluation and in selecting appropriate therapy. Important questions to ask are duration of illness; volume of stool; presence of blood or pus in stool; and symptoms of systemic illness such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, and volume depletion. Most patients should not undergo further evaluation at this time, but they should be treated symptomatically. However, the presence of systemic symptoms dictates that the stool be more closely evaluated for evidence of invasive infection or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
B. The simplest test that can be performed in the office to evaluate inflammatory changes of the bowel mucosa is to inspect by microscopy a fecal sample for WBCs/RBCs. The presence of either of these implies infection with invasive organisms and/or IBD.
C. To evaluate infection by an invasive bacterial organism, a stool culture is necessary. Most clinical laboratories routinely test for Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter spp. If travel or other historical features suggest other pathogens, more specific testing for Amoeba, Yersinia spp., or Clostridium difficile and others may be necessary. In certain clinical situations, testing for certain types of Escherichia coli may be prudent. In patients with HIV disease, testing for unusual pathogens (e.g., cryptosporidia, mycobacteria) may be necessary.
D. In patients who have WBCs/RBCs in the stool and a negative culture, or those without inflammatory cells but continued diarrhea, perform flexible sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for IBD, which may be present even if the mucosa is grossly normal appearing. Therefore, a biopsy is helpful in detecting minimal mucosal changes. In addition, the histologic appearance in the setting of gross inflammatory changes can help differentiate acute infectious self-limited colitis from IBD. Generally, perform a biopsy irrespective of gross findings.
E. In patients with negative cultures and sigmoidoscopy but continued diarrhea, further evaluation may be required.
