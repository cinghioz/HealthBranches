Chronic stable angina is most commonly a manifestation of progressive obstruction of the coronary arteries by atheromatous plaque. Management of stable angina can be approached through lifestyle, pharmacologic, and invasive means aimed at reducing the imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply versus demand, delaying the progression of atherosclerosis, and stabilizing vulnerable coronary atheroma. Discussion among physicians and patients regarding the goals and risks of therapy is essential in the management of this condition.
A. The history and physical examination should be targeted to determine the severity and pattern of symptoms, underlying risk factors, concomitant exacerbating diseases, and signs or symptoms of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. A fasting lipid profile, blood glucose, and ECG should be obtained. When possible, correct exacerbating medications/conditions, including anemia, hyperthyroidism, and tachyarrhythmia.
B. Behavioral risk factor assessment and modifications are essential; this includes diet restrictions, exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation.
C. Preventive pharmacologic therapies should be instituted in cases in which lifestyle modifications are not sufficient. All patients without contraindication should take aspirin for secondary prevention. Blood pressure and dyslipidemia should be controlled to target for those with coronary artery disease (CAD)(Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC 7] and National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP]).
D. Risk assessment should be initiated. If evidence of LV dysfunction or high-risk CAD is present by history, examination, chest x-ray, or ECG, cardiac catheterization may be considered. If risk stratification is incomplete, assess LV function and perform stress testing (unless contraindications exist).
E. Stress testing is considered to confirm the diagnosis in those with intermediate probability of CAD, to provide additional prognostic information needed to guide management, and to aid in directing intervention in patients with prior revascularization. Exercise testing is preferred to pharmacologic stress testing because the former provides valuable functional data. Exercise ECG is the first line if the ECG is interpretable. Imaging enhances prognostic assessment by localizing and quantifying the extent of ischemia and prior infarction and is necessary if the ECG is uninterpretable.
F. Assessment of symptom severity (and responsiveness to therapy) along with prognosis guides therapy for stable angina.
G. Pharmacologic therapy should be instituted for persistent symptoms. A beta blocker is generally preferred as initial therapy unless contraindications exist. Calcium antagonists may be preferred in specific situations such as pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma), conduction abnormality (dihydropyridine), and vasospastic angina. Long-acting nitrates may be added for persistent symptoms. Combined therapy with a beta blocker and long-acting nitrates is superior to use of either agent alone for symptom relief.
H. The method of revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] vs. coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is addressed once significant coronary disease is identified by angiography. CABG is preferred for certain anatomic subsets, in particular in those with a large territory of jeopardized myocardium, in patients with diabetes mellitus, in those with LV dysfunction, and in patients with lesions not amenable to PCI. The patient's surgical risk must also be considered when deciding among methods of intervention.
I. The patient's clinical status and symptom severity should be reassessed after medical or mechanical intervention. Patients who experience significant symptoms after maximal medical therapy should be considered for angiography and intervention. For patients who have been revascularized to the extent possible and still have significant symptoms despite maximal medication, alternative approaches (spinal cord stimulation, etc.) can be considered.
