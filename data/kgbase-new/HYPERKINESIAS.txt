Disorders of movement are generally classified into two categories: those with too little movement (hypokinesias) and those with excess movement (hyperkinesias). Hypokinetic movement disorders include Parkinson's disease (see Parkinson's Disease chapter) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. The focus of this chapter is hyperkinesias, which include involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics, and tremor (see Tremor chapter). Most movement disorders result from impairment of the basal ganglia circuitry. The key to diagnosis of hyperkinesias is history and neurologic examination.
A. Chorea is defined as brief, irregular, nonsustained movements that flow between muscle groups and can be partially suppressible. Other similar types of irregular, flowing movements include athetosis and ballism. Athetosis is slower than chorea and more typically affects distal extremities. Ballism describes large-amplitude choreic movements. The etiologies of chorea encompass primary causes such as inherited disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Wilson's disease, and ataxia-telangiectasia), secondary causes (e.g., infections, structural lesions, and metabolic abnormalities), and physiologic chorea (seen in infancy). Treatment of chorea is challenging, but symptoms may be controlled with amantadine, neuroleptics, and dopamine-depleting agents such as tetrabenazine and reserpine.
B. Dystonia results from uncontrolled co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles causing abnormal postures of the affected body part. It can be classified by location (focal or generalized) or by etiology. Examples of focal dystonia include cervical dystonia (torticollis), blepharospasm, task-specific dystonia (writer's cramp, embouchure dystonia), and spasmodic dysphonia. Generalized dystonia can result from inherited disorders, including DYT-1 dystonia (Oppenheim dystonia) and dopa-responsive dystonia; from perinatal injury; or from heredodegenerative diseases (e.g., Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease). Dystonia may be alleviated by anticholinergics, baclofen, or benzodiazepines. Botulinum toxin injections into affected muscles work well for many types of focal dystonia. Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus is used to treat medication-refractory dystonia, particularly DYT-1 dystonia. Dopa-responsive dystonia is exquisitely sensitive to low doses of levodopa.
C. Myoclonus is a rapid involuntary movement; it can be positive, as in a muscle contraction, or negative if there is a lapse of muscle tone. Asterixis is a form of negative myoclonus and is seen in patients with metabolic or toxic encephalopathies such as hepatic dysfunction. Myoclonus can be generalized, focal, or segmental. It may result from damage to the cortex, brainstem spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. It is common in some types of seizure disorders (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) and is frequently seen after global hypoxic injury. Myoclonus may respond to treatment with benzodiazepines.
D. Tics are also rapid movements of particular body parts but range in severity from being simple motor tics involving one muscle group to complex and repetitive movements of multiple muscle groups. Tics are considered to be involuntary, but they are associated with a premonitory "urge" and can be suppressed briefly. Tics may change in severity, location, and frequency over time. When motor tics appear in combination with vocal tics, a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome should be considered. Tics are commonly treated with clonidine, neuroleptics, or dopamine depleters when necessary.
Tardive dyskinesia is a term describing a potentially permanent movement disorder that results from the use of dopamine-blocking agents such as neuroleptics and antiemetics (metoclopramide). It is characterized by choreic and/or dystonic movements affecting any part of the body but particularly affecting the mouth and tongue (orobuccal lingual dyskinesias).
