Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disease that affects 10%-15% of the population and is thought to be a gut motor-sensory disorder, the basis of which is physiologic but the manifestations of which are affected by various environmental (e.g., foods) and host (e.g., stress, comorbid illness, prior psychological/physiologic trauma) factors. Although there are many functional gut diseases, IBS primarily is a disease of colonic dysfunction. Subclassification of IBS may be helpful in disease management strategies because the various subtypes are associated with different treatment choices and pathophysiologic mechanisms. The subtypes are based on stool consistency alone and include IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS mixed type (IBS-M), and IBS unsubtyped (IBS-U). Patients with IBS-M have both hard and loose stools over periods of hours or days, whereas IBS patients with alternating bowel habits change subtype over periods of weeks and months. A unifying biochemical cause of IBS is not established, but in many patients the pathophysiology appears to involve serotonergic signaling of colonic motor and sensory function. There is no laboratory test that can be used to diagnose IBS. Instead the diagnosis is based on the characteristic symptoms (Table 1), although it may be necessary to exclude other conditions that can mimic or produce IBS-like symptoms (e.g., colitis, lactose intolerance, sprue) through focused laboratory testing. However, routine laboratory tests are not indicated or necessary to make the diagnosis of IBS. It is important to assess for "alarm flag" symptoms (weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia, or nocturnal symptoms) because these symptoms may indicate underlying serious diseases and should prompt further diagnostic evaluation.
