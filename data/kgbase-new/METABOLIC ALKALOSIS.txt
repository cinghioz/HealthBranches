A. Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in the serum bicarbonate concentration. This occurs because of a loss of H+ from the body or a gain in HCO3. In its pure form, it manifests as alkalemia (pH >7.40). As a compensatory mechanism, metabolic alkalosis leads to alveolar hypoventilation with an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), which diminishes the change in pH that would otherwise occur. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance observed in hospitalized patients, accounting for approximately 50% of all acid-base disorders. Common causes of a metabolic alkalosis are shown in Table 1. Urinary chloride concentration provides a useful paradigm for classification of patients because it represents a convenient measure of extracellular volume. Clinical manifestations are summarized in Table 2.
B. Pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis should be considered in two phases—initiation and maintenance. Metabolic alkalosis is induced by virtue of a loss of acid, gain of alkali, or the effects of a contracted extracellular fluid compartment (increasing the bicarbonate concentration). Whenever a hydrogen ion is excreted, a bicarbonate ion is gained into the extracellular space. Examples of loss of acid include vomiting, nasogastric (NG) suction, and aldosterone-mediated secretion of hydrogen ions in the collecting duct (e.g., in primary hyperaldosteronism). Gain of alkali may be observed in patients administered alkali in excess of the kidney's excretory capacity. Contraction alkalosis is most frequently observed in patients treated zealously with diuretics or in patients with chloride-rich diarrhea. The maintenance of metabolic alkalosis is influenced by renal hypoperfusion (e.g., in patients who are volume depleted) that results in secondary hyperaldosteronism and thus distal nephron secretion of hydrogen ions. Other important factors include chloride depletion from either GI or renal loss of chloride. Chloride depletion enhances bicarbonate reabsorption through stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and by inhibition of bicarbonate secretion by the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger.
C. Diagnostic approach to metabolic alkalosis:
1. Establish the presence of metabolic alkalosis and assess whether the secondary (compensatory) physiologic response is appropriate.
2. Identify the underlying cause that precipitated alkalosis.
3. Assess the factors responsible for maintaining alkalosis, such as extracellular volume depletion. The treatment of a metabolic alkalosis depends on identifying and repairing the underlying cause (e.g., repairing the volume, discontinuing NG suction, or stopping diuretic therapy).
D. The treatment of metabolic alkalosis comprises general therapy based on the severity of the alkalosis and more specific therapy based on the underlying initiating cause of the metabolic alkalosis.
General therapy: Treatment of asymptomatic patients with a mild to moderate alkalosis (pH 7.45–7.6) should involve volume repletion; if necessary, the use of acetazolamide (250–500 mg bid or tid) to cause an alkaline urine rich in bicarbonate may be sufficient. For patients with more severe metabolic alkalosis (pH >7.60) or those who are symptomatic, hydrochloric acid infusion may be necessary. This is usually administered as a 0.1-0.2 M HCl solution into a large vein.
Specific therapy: This should be determined by whether the patient has a “chloride-responsive” or “chloride-resistant" alkalosis. Chloride-responsive alkalosis in the setting of volume depletion is best treated with IV infusion of isotonic sodium chloride solution. However, chloride-responsive alkalosis in edematous states such as congestive heart failure usually necessitates more
