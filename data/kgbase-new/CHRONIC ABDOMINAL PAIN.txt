Chronic abdominal pain is a common and challenging symptom that is commonly evaluated by primary care providers, gastroenterologists, and surgeons. The vast majority of these patients have a functional disorder. Chronic intractable or undiagnosed abdominal pain is defined by the presence of abdominal pain for at least 6 months without a specific diagnosis after an adequate evaluation. Differentiating functional GI disorders from organic pathology is essential for clinical management. In the United States, it is estimated that the prevalence of chronic functional abdominal pain is 2%, and it occurs primarily in women.

A. A careful, detailed history and physical examination are mandatory to direct further evaluation. Determining the pattern of pain, type of pain, and overall time course of the illness often leads to a systematic and reasonable evaluation. Also, specific details about the pain, such as location, characteristics, alleviating or aggravating factors, and chronology of events, often help to narrow a broad differential diagnosis. Associated symptoms, such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, weight gain or loss, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, change in the color of urine or stool, or change in the diameter of stool should be included in the history. In women, a menstrual history should be obtained.
B. Biliary tract disease leads to intermittent acute pain that is usually localized to the right upper quadrant or the epigastric area that lasts for 15 minutes or a few hours. The pain may radiate to the back or scapula and is often associated with restlessness, sweating, or vomiting. Episodes are typically separated by weeks to months. A history of recurrent pancreatitis or excessive alcohol intake should raise the possibility of chronic pancreatitis. Upper GI symptoms can be related to ulcer or nonulcer dyspepsia. Postprandial abdominal pain may be related to underlying chronic intestinal ischemia, gastroparesis, intermittent intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, or peptic ulcer disease. Features that suggest organic illness include unstable weight loss, fever, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, symptoms or signs of GI blood loss, anemia, and signs of malnutrition and abnormal physical findings.
C. Chronic pain originating from the abdominal wall may be confused with visceral pain, often leading to extensive evaluation. Chronic abdominal wall pain may be related to nerve entrapment, radicular pain radiating from T7 to T12 lesions, or referred pain from abdominal or thoracic lesions. Radicular pain across the abdomen may also be worse with movement and may be caused by irritation of the spinal nerve root from disc and vertebral body disease, a meningeal tumor, tabes dorsalis secondary to syphilis or diabetes, or postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment with a local anesthetic agent is effective for most patients with chronic abdominal wall and radicular pain, which can further confirm the diagnosis.
D. Pelvic pain can be from either GI or gynecologic causes. Common gynecologic sources of pelvic pain include ovarian and uterine tumors, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometriosis.
E. Metabolic disorders may rarely be associated with abdominal pain. These include acute intermittent porphyria, adrenal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, or hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Other rare causes include familial Mediterranean fever, hereditary angioedema, diabetic neuropathy, and carcinoid syndrome.
F. Features suggesting irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are pain for at least 12 weeks (not necessarily consecutive) associated with bowel habit changes, no alarming features, and the absence of nocturnal symptoms. Pain relief with defecation, mucus in the stool, and sensation of incomplete evacuation are typical. Abdominal pain in IBS is usually a crampy sensation of variable intensity and periodic exacerbations. Functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) follows specific diagnostic characteristics. The Rome II criteria for functional abdominal pain include at least 6 months of the following symptoms:
• Continuous or nearly continuous abdominal pain
• None or occasional relationship of pain with physiologic events
• Some loss of daily functioning
• Real pain (i.e., the pain is not feigned)
• Insufficient criteria for other functional gastrointestinal disorders that would explain abdominal pain
G. Chronic mesenteric ischemia, also known as intestinal angina, is manifested by recurrent abdominal pain, which usually develops in patients with mesenteric atherosclerotic disease. Patients complain of dull, crampy postprandial epigastric pain within the first hour after eating. The pain subsides in the next couple of hours. Weight loss is seen in about 80% of the patients.
