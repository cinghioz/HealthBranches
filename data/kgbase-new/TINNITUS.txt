Tinnitus is a perceived sound that is not related to an external source. It usually is described by patients as a ringing, clicking, humming, or blowing sound. Most patients with tinnitus have an underlying otologic problem, most commonly hearing loss. It is postulated that tinnitus is the result of an imbalance between excitation and inhibition of auditory pathways. The imbalance may occur at any level, including cochlear hair cells, midbrain, and cortical central auditory pathways.

A. Diagnosing the cause of tinnitus requires a detailed history. Onset, duration, frequency, and localization are helpful in the evaluation for the underlying cause. Tinnitus may be caused by systemic disease, infection, metabolic abnormalities, medication exposure, or inflammatory conditions. Review exposure to aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, salicylates, quinine, antimalarials, NSAIDs, and any history of toxic exposure to heavy metals with the patient.
B. The physical examination should include a check of the blood pressure, a head and neck examination, and an auscultation for vascular bruits and heart murmurs.
C. If tinnitus is diffuse and not localized to either ear, consider encephalitis of the temporal lobe and psychiatric illnesses. Auditory hallucinations are noted primarily in patients with psychosis.
D. It occurs in objective (perceived by the examiner and patient) and subjective (heard only by the patient) forms.
E. Subjective tinnitus is more common than objective tinnitus, but diagnosis of the underlying cause is more difficult. The differential diagnoses of subjective tinnitus are medication and toxic exposure, metabolic abnormalities, pathologic condition in the peripheral (cochlear) or central(retrocochlear) pathways, anxiety, depression, and dental disorders. Metabolic abnormalities include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and zinc deficiency. The initial workup of a patient should include a CBC, fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Pathologic conditions of the ear associated with subjective tinnitus include otosclerosis, chronic suppurative otitis media, Meniere's disease, presbycusis, and noise-induced hearing loss.
F. Objective tinnitus is rare. Causes include acquired and congenital vascular malformations, neuromuscular disorders (palatal myoclonus, stapedius muscle spasm, and temporomandibular disorders), intracranial tumors, and structural defects of the ear. Objective tinnitus is of two types: vascular and mechanical.
G. Pulsatile tinnitus refers to nonexternal sounds that are amplified and synchronous with the patient's pulse. Benign intracranial hypertension, jugular bulb abnormalities, and aberrant carotid artery are included in the differential diagnoses. High-resolution CT of the temporal bones is needed when a retrotympanic mass is noted on examination. MRI and angiography are indicated for patients with normal otoscopic examination to evaluate for dural venous thromboses and to look for the empty sella and small ventricles associated with benign intracranial hypertension. Angiography is used when atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and small dural arteriovenous (AV) malformations are suspected and the patient is a surgical candidate.
H. Stapedial muscle spasm-induced tinnitus is amplified with external noise and is intermittent. Stapedial muscle spasm is associated with facial nerve palsies, although it can occur without them. Division of the stapedius muscle and tensor tympani tendons is reserved for severe cases. Long-term use of benzodiazepines for stapedial muscle spasm is not recommended.
I. Palatal myoclonus is apparent on examination of the oral cavity. The tinnitus is thought to be generated from the opening and closing of the eustachian tube and the rubbing of mucosal surfaces. Electromyography (EMG) of the palatal muscles confirms the diagnosis. Treatment with benzodiazepines results in a decrease in anxiety.
J. Tinnitus associated with the patulous eustachian tube is synchronous with breathing. The patient may experience autophony (hearing of his or her own voice or breathing). Rapid weight loss and high estrogen states (e.g., use of birth control pills, postpartum) are associated with patulous eustachian tubes.
K. Hearing evaluations include assessment of sensorineural hearing impedance testing and speech discrimination. These tests assist in localizing the otologic deficit. Nonvibratory tinnitus lesions can be attributed to defects in the cochlea (75%), CNS (18%), and middle ear (4%).
L. Peripheral tinnitus is associated with symmetric hearing loss, usually gradual in onset. Presbycusis is common with this condition. As hearing loss increases, tinnitus increases. Treating the hearing loss may result in a decrease in tinnitus because ambient background noise is amplified. In patients with hearing loss that is not treatable by a surgical procedure, a hearing aid may improve the tinnitus. Hearing aids and masking devices may be used together in patients who do not respond to hearing aids alone. Medications should be given to patients with severe disability.
M. Central tinnitus requires an evaluation for posterior fossa problems, including cerebellopontine angle tumors. The most common cerebellopontine tumor is the acoustic neuroma. Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and disequilibrium. Distinguishing Meniere's disease from acoustic neuromas is difficult clinically. Meniere's tinnitus is intermittent, whereas the tinnitus of acoustic neuroma is constant. Meniere's disease is associated with vertigo as distinguished from the disequilibrium of an acoustic neuroma. MRI with gadolinium contrast to assess for posterior masses is indicated for abnormal auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests. The sensitivity for acoustic neuromas <15 mm is greater with MRI with gadolinium contrast than with high-resolution CT. In patients with unilateral hearing loss and normal ABR tests, surveillance is required at 6 months and 1 year to assess for progression of symptoms. ENT referrals are indicated for all patients with asymmetric hearing loss. Treatment for tumors depends on the size, location, and the patient's preoperative state.
N. Conductive hearing loss requires evaluation for a pathologic condition of the external and middle ear, malignancy, glomus tumor, and cholesteatoma. Early referral to ENT is recommended.
