A. Several dermatologic conditions are associated with localized hyperhidrosis: increased sweating in areas of vitiligo, granulosis, rubra nasi, dyshidrotic eczema, pachydermoperiostosis, epidermolysis, bullosa, pachyonychia congenita, nail-patella syndrome, palmoplantar keratodermas, and others. These conditions should be detectable on physical examination.
B. Anxiety or stimulants may increase sweating, but some people have severe hyperhidrosis without an obvious precipitating event. Such patients often have a family history of hyperhidrosis. Severe hyperhidrosis may cause difficulty with hand work, infection caused by the moist environment (especially in the feet), and considerable social distress. Topical treatments have varying success. Treatment with botulinum toxin A, iontophoresis, sympathectomy, or removal of the axillary sweat glands gives good results in severe cases (see references).
C. A structural lesion in the sympathetic nervous system may cause abnormalities in sweating. Cerebrocortical tumors, stroke, or infection may cause contralateral hyperhidrosis through release of inhibition. When injured sympathetic nerves regrow, connections may develop between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. This can result in sweating of the innervated skin, as seen with gustatory sweating. Spinal cord disease (including syringomyelia, spinal cord injury, tabes dorsalis) may cause segmental areas of hyperhidrosis. Thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk injury may also cause localized hyperhidrosis. A large area of anhidrosis, as in severe diabetic autonomic neuropathy or after a sympathectomy involving more than one limb, may result in compensatory hyperhidrosis of other areas.
D. Many chemicals may cause sweating, either during withdrawal states (as from alcohol or opiates) or with use (e.g., alcohol, antidepressants, some antipsychotics, "triptans," theophylline, sildenafil, opiates, cholinergic and adrenergic agents, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and others). Chronic ingestion of mercury or arsenic can cause excessive sweating.
E. Malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, brucellosis, abdominal abscesses, rheumatic fever, and endocarditis are commonly seen with fevers and sweats as the predominant symptoms, but any infection producing a fever may cause sweating through the hypothalamic temperature regulatory centers as the fever falls. Even after a severe febrile illness resolves, patients may continue to have sweats for days to months.
F. Certain malignant conditions, including lymphoma, monocytic leukemia, and renal carcinoma, classically cause fevers, but fever with associated sweats also may be found in other malignancies. Carcinoid syndrome may cause excessive sweating. Rheumatologic diseases associated with excessive sweating include rheumatoid arthritis and Raynaud's phenomenon.
G. Other endocrine causes of hyperhidrosis include menopause, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, gout, obesity, porphyria, rickets, and hyperpituitarism. In some cases of hypoglycemia, CNS dysfunction and sweat may occur in the absence of other adrenergic symptoms.
