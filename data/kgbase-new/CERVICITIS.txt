A. Although acute cervicitis can result from trauma, malignancy, or systemic collagen vascular conditions, it is most commonly caused by infectious agents, notably *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Chlamydia trachomatis*, and to a lesser extent herpes simplex virus (HSV). The epidemiology of these pathogens is similar, and 25%â€“45% of patients have concomitant infections. Assessing a patient's risk for cervical infection involves taking a careful history, including age at first sexual contact, number of sex partners, and history of previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It is important to distinguish infections of the lower genital tract limited to the cervix (cervicitis) from those occurring in the vagina (vaginitis) or vulva (vulvitis) and from upper genital tract disease, such as PID. When cervicitis is associated with signs or symptoms of systemic disease, including fever, lower abdominal pain, or pelvic pain, consider PID as an additional diagnosis. Cervicitis generally is associated with mucopurulent discharge collected from the cervix and posterior vaginal fornix. Because the vaginal discharge associated with vaginitis often appears similar, it is prudent to evaluate the discharge for the common vaginal pathogens (candidal vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, and *Trichomonas vaginalis*). For patients with a confirmed diagnosis of cervicitis who are at risk for STDs, offer screening for other STDs, including syphilis, HIV, and human papillomavirus (HPV), and Pap smear with reflexive HPV testing, if not screened in the past year.
B. Too often, lower abdominal pain in sexually active women prompts the diagnosis of PID without application of criteria to substantiate the diagnosis. Hager's criteria for diagnosing acute salpingitis are listed in Table 1. The severity of the illness determines whether outpatient care or hospitalization is appropriate. Inpatient parenteral regimens combine a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (cefoxitin or cefotetan) with tetracycline (doxycycline) or clindamycin with an aminoglycoside. The preferred outpatient regimen combines ceftriaxone with tetracycline (doxycycline), but quinolones (ofloxacin) can be combined with either metronidazole (Flagyl) or clindamycin. If pregnancy is possible, avoid tetracyclines and quinolones.
C. Cervical ulcerations often are accompanied by inguinal or vulvar adenopathy. Pain distinguishes HSV from syphilitic lesions in primary outbreaks. Primary genital HSV often involves the vulva, urethra, and cervix, progressing from multiple painful vesicles to ulcers in the presence of a systemic viremia. Recurrent HSV occurs in the presence of circulating antibodies and is associated with an infection of muted duration and intensity. Acyclovir is the mainstay of treatment and is particularly effective in primary infections in which early intervention significantly reduces viral shedding, accelerates healing, and hastens recovery. Because acyclovir therapy has been changed to less frequent dosing (400 mg three times a day) with proven efficacy, compliance is favored. Valacyclovir and famciclovir, two newer acyclic nucleoside derivatives, also may be considered for primary treatment of genital HSV. Syphilis, by contrast, usually manifests on the cervix in a primary infection; however, because it usually is asymptomatic, it is rarely diagnosed at this stage. Identification of the stage of infection plays a major role in determining the duration of treatment. Penicillin is the drug of choice, with almost no reported resistant strains.
D. When a growth is noted on the cervix in association with cervicitis and discharge, obtain a cervical biopsy specimen from the leading edge of the lesion to exclude endophytic cervical neoplasia. More commonly, a whitish exophytic lesion is associated with genital warts or HPV. These lesions by themselves usually represent an infectious process involving HPV serotypes 6 and 11. The HPV serotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, and 35) are recognized for their contribution to the neoplastic transformation that can promote cervical cancer. Application of 3% acetic acid to the cervix, along with colposcopically directed biopsies, enables distinction between infectious and neoplastic lesions. This distinction influences the choice of treatment. In rare instances tuberculous cervicitis manifests as a mucopurulent discharge or fungating mass. Diagnosis is made by cervical biopsy demonstrating caseating granulomas or acid-fast bacilli stain or culture.
E. Gonococcal endocervicitis manifests symptoms, including mucopurulent vaginal discharge, uterine bleeding, and dysuria, in 40%-60% of infections. The gold standard for the diagnosis is an endocervical culture plated on modified Thayer-Martin medium. More practical are newer rapid-assay techniques, such as Gonozyme. Also, DNA probes are now available that have similar accuracy to culture but have the convenience of not needing to be processed immediately, as do the cultures. Although procaine penicillin G, ampicillin, and amoxicillin continue to be effective, ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly is preferred. The single treatment ensures compliance while simultaneously covering penicillinase-producing and chromosomally mediated resistant *N. gonorrhoeae*. Alternative treatments include fluoroquinolones (a single intramuscular dose of ciprofloxacin 500 mg, ofloxacin 400 mg, or levofloxacin 250 mg), although it must be noted that there is a rising incidence of quinolone-resistant strains. Although *Chlamydia* is the most prevalent sexually transmitted organism in the United States, acute cervical infection often is asymptomatic. *Chlamydia* is readily diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification. Direct culture, fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining, or enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) is an alternative method of diagnosis. Both of these methods are comparable to culture in their specificity and sensitivity and are less expensive. Azithromycin 1 g as a single, observed dose is the preferred therapeutic regimen. Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days is an alternative choice, although it is less preferred as a result of the problems with compliance and should be avoided in pregnancy. When both *N. gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia* are present, azithromycin 2 g as a single dose can be used alone. Because both *N. gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia* are reportable STDs, encourage patients to facilitate the evaluation and treatment of their sex partners. In some cases it may be helpful to obtain a test of cure to verify both patient compliance and microbial sensitivity.
