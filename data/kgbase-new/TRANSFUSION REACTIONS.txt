In past decades, three viruses comprised the most important infectious risks of transfusion: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. In the United States, improvements in donor screening (e.g., nucleic acid testing) have all but eliminated transfusion transmission of HIV and HCV. The per unit risks are now approximately 1 in 2 million for HIV and HCV and 1 in 200,000 for HBV. With the rates of HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission having dropped so low, other transfusion risks have gained new prominence. The most significant infectious risk of transfusion is now sepsis from a bacterially contaminated platelet unit. Platelets (PLTs) must be stored at room temperature. Bacteria can be cultured from about 1 in 3000 PLT units, and a clinically significant septic reaction is thought to occur in about 1 in 20,000 PLT transfusions. The other most important current risks of transfusion are as follows: (1) transfusion-related acute lung injury (per unit risk of 1/5000) and (2) transfusion of the wrong RBC unit, typically resulting from a patient identification error (per unit risk of 1/12,000 to 1/19,000).
A. In general, any adverse clinical event that occurs during a blood transfusion should be considered a transfusion reaction until proved otherwise. Steps to take when a transfusion reaction is suspected include the following: (1) stop the transfusion and notify the blood bank; (2) reconfirm the identity of the patient and unit immediately; (3) draw a fresh blood sample, and send it plus the remaining blood component to the blood bank. The blood bank will perform a clerical check, examine the recipient's plasma for visible hemolysis, and perform a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to look for antibody-coated red cells in the recipient.
B. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when pre-formed antibodies in the recipient bind to transfused RBCs. The classic example is an ABO-incompatible transfusion (e.g., A donor/O recipient). The antibody-antigen interaction can lead to complement fixation, cytokine effects, renal failure, and DIC. Fever is the most common sign. Other signs and symptoms may include rigors; pain at the infusion site or in the chest, abdomen, or flanks; nausea/vomiting; and shock. In anesthetized patients, red urine may be the only presenting sign. The transfusion should be stopped immediately. Blood pressure support and maintaining adequate renal perfusion are primary concerns. Patients should be hydrated with normal saline + diuretics.
C. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are anamnestic anti-RBC antibody responses that occur 1-2 weeks posttransfusion. Patients are often asymptomatic. Decreased survival of transfused RBCs may be suspected based on a falling hemoglobin/hematocrit level and an increased bilirubin. The DAT is usually positive. Treatment is supportive; the patient's CBC and renal status should be monitored.
D. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are generally defined as a temperature increase of at least 1° C in the setting of transfusion, for which no other cause can be established. These reactions are typically benign, but other, more serious causes of fever must be excluded (i.e., hemolytic and septic reactions). Proposed mechanisms of FNHTR include (1) recipient antibody interacting with transfused leukocytes and (2) transfusion of cytokines that have accumulated during storage. The use of prestorage leukoreduced blood products has decreased the incidence of FNHTRs. These reactions generally respond well to acetaminophen administration.
E. Allergic transfusion reactions are caused by allergies to donor plasma proteins. Allergic reactions to blood products span the entire spectrum from mild urticarial reactions to full-blown anaphylaxis. For reactions limited to urticaria only (i.e., no bronchospasm or hypotension) it is acceptable to stop the transfusion, treat with antihistamines, and restart the infusion if the symptoms resolve. Epinephrine is the mainstay of treatment for anaphylactic transfusion reactions.
F. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is characterized by acute-onset hypoxemia and the appearance of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray within 6 hours of transfusion of a plasma-containing component. The acute respiratory distress syndrome seen is noncardiogenic in nature but may be difficult to distinguish from circulatory overload. Multiple mechanisms for TRALI have been proposed. In at least a subset of cases, TRALI is precipitated by passive transfusion of donor antibodies (usually anti-human leukocyte antigen) that react with recipient cells. Care is supportive. All patients with TRALI require supplemental oxygen, and about 75% need mechanical ventilatory support. Although most patients with TRALI recover spontaneously over 2-4 days, there is a 5%-10% mortality rate.
G. Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare but devastating complication of blood transfusion that primarily affects recipients who are immunocompromised. Viable lymphocytes in the transfused blood component attack host tissues, leading to severe rash, diarrhea, and pancytopenia within 7–10 days of transfusion. TA-GVHD is almost uniformly fatal. There is no treatment, but TA-GVHD can be prevented effectively by providing irradiated blood products.
