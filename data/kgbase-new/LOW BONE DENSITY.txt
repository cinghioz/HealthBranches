Low bone density is diagnosed by a bone mineral density (BMD) test and may be caused by osteoporosis (decreased bone mass with disrupted architecture), osteomalacia (disordered bone mineralization), or osteitis fibrosa cystica (characterized by marrow fibrosis).

A. In addition to a careful history and physical examination to identify potential underlying causes for low bone density, some experts also recommend a CBC, urinary calcium excretion, thyroid function, and serum chemistries (calcium, phosphorus, total protein, liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and electrolytes). If the history or evaluation suggests secondary causes, additional tests for serum 25-OH vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), ESR, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis can be considered.
B. In primary osteoporosis, laboratory study results should be normal. Abnormal study results may suggest an associated disorder.
The most common laboratory abnormalities in osteomalacia are hypophosphatemia and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. A low alkaline phosphatase suggests hypophosphatasia. Hypophosphatemia with hypocalcemia usually indicates vitamin D deficiency, whereas isolated hypophosphatemia is most consistent with a renal tubular phosphate-wasting syndrome.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed by a combination of hypercalcemia and an inappropriately elevated serum PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism as a result of renal failure will show a decreased serum calcium, increased serum phosphate, and increased serum PTH.
C. Vertebral fracture is the most common clinical presentation of osteoporosis. Primary osteoporosis is defined as the progressive loss of bone increasing with age.
D. Secondary osteoporosis can result from underlying medical conditions, including malabsorption; hypogonadism; hyperthyroidism; multiple myeloma; and the administration of certain medications, especially corticosteroids. Of the secondary causes, vitamin D deficiency and glucocorticoid use are among the most common.
E. The major symptom of osteomalacia is diffuse, dull, aching skeletal pain that is worsened by activity. Muscle weakness, usually involving the proximal musculature, is often present. Vitamin D deficiency accounts for the majority of cases of osteomalacia and can be caused by dietary deficiency or malabsorption resulting from GI disorders. Hypophosphatemia resulting from renal wasting is another important cause and can result from vitamin D deficiency, from primary renal tubular wasting, or as part of Fanconi's syndrome (e.g., as may be seen in multiple myeloma). Chronic renal failure can lead to decreased vitamin D metabolism and secondary hyperparathyroidism and can contribute to osteomalacia. Disorders of bone matrix such as hypophosphatasia, fibrogenesis imperfecta, and axial osteomalacia are rare causes of osteomalacia.
F. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is caused by hyperparathyroidism and is now rare. Many patients with hyperparathyroidism, however, do have low bone mineral density.
