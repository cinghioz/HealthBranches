Several points deserve immediate mention. First, patients who require emergent surgery clearly do not benefit from the delay necessary for preoperative evaluation. Second, preoperative evaluation does not “clear” a patient for surgery and such terminology should be avoided. Preoperative evaluation provides an assessment of medical risk and the identification of measures to reduce that risk. Third, consultants need to have a clear understanding of their role in patient care. Formally speaking, consultants generate suggestions only and do not write orders. However, it is not uncommon for surgeons to expect “co-management” rather than formal consultation. In the latter, medical consultants are expected to assume responsibility for all nonsurgical matters relating to patient care.
A. Preoperative evaluation means an assessment of cardiac risk. The goal of perioperative cardiac risk assessment is to identify those patients with unstable cardiac disease for whom further study and treatment warrants the risk of surgical delay. The newest guidelines from the American College of Cardiology are summarized in the algorithm. Stress testing is unnecessary in patients with adequate functional capacity (e.g., can walk up a flight of stairs). Moreover, such testing should not be recommended unless patients are willing to postpone surgery so as to proceed with cardiac revascularization. Such delay may itself be harmful in the patient who is bedridden and thus at risk for decubitus ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and functional decline. The use of coronary stents mandates postoperative use of antiplatelet agents. Cessation of these agents risks in-stent restenosis. Continuation of these agents risks perioperative bleeding. Discuss these issues with patients and their families before ordering a stress test. The same American College of Cardiology guidelines also state that there is no indication for routine preoperative echocardiography. An echocardiogram is reserved for patients whose clinical presentation is worrisome for undiagnosed heart failure.
Recent data help guide the consultant when faced with a positive stress test result in the preoperative period. The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial indicated that patients with stable coronary disease do not benefit from preoperative revascularization. Exclusion criteria to this study included those with >50% left main disease, an ejection fraction <20%, and severe aortic stenosis. This study reinforces the concept that preoperative patients fall under the same guidelines for cardiac revascularization as do all other patients.
Beta blockers are often routinely prescribed to reduce perioperative cardiac risk. However, a 2005 study suggests that only those at high risk benefit from beta blockers. Those at moderate risk did not benefit, and those at low risk actually experienced increased mortality. Thus, beta blockers are recommended only in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) or two or more of the following risk factors: congestive heart failure (CHF), CAD, cardiovascular accident (CVA), diastolic murmur (DM), or Cardiac Risk Index (CRI) (Cr >2) who are undergoing vascular or intermediate-risk (intrathoracic, intraperitoneal, orthopedic) surgery.
B. Postoperative pulmonary complications may occur more frequently than cardiac events. Such events include atelectasis, bronchospasm, pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and exacerbation of underlying lung disease. Arozullah and colleagues have published a respiratory failure index that predicts the risk of respiratory failure based on the type of surgery, patient risk factors, and functional status. However, it is not surprising that patients with established lung disease are at higher risk for perioperative pulmonary complications. The role of the consultant is to identify patients with reversible pulmonary pathology who would benefit from preoperative intervention. Such patients may require pulmonary evaluation via chest x-ray, pulmonary function testing, and possibly ABG assessment. The results of such testing can then be used to determine disease-specific therapy, which, in turn, minimizes postoperative complications. Those with previously identified pulmonary pathology and baseline symptomatology do not require investigation or change in management. Patients undergoing lung resection or who are likely to have a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation benefit from early pulmonology input. All current smokers should be advised to discontinue tobacco use (preferably at least 2 months prior to surgery).
Endocrine disorders that are frequently encountered during preoperative evaluation include diabetes, thyroid disease, and adrenal insufficiency. The American Diabetes Association has endorsed the following goals for glycemic control in hospitalized patients: 90 to 130 preprandial blood sugars and <180 postprandial blood sugars. However, the bulk of the data in favor of tight blood sugar control in hospitalized patients comes from studies performed in the intensive care and critical care unit settings. Consultants need to be aware that hypoglycemia may be a greater threat than hyperglycemia in the acute setting of hospitalization. Nonetheless, there are convincing data that random blood sugars should be maintained at <200. Metformin should be discontinued in all hospitalized patients because of the increased risk of hypovolemia, hypoxia, and acute renal failure-induced lactic acidosis in this setting.
C. The interpretation of thyroid tests is problematic in acutely ill, hospitalized patients. Thus, such testing is discouraged unless there is a high suspicion of thyroid disease. The available data suggest that there is minimal additional surgical risk in those with mild or moderate hypothyroidism. Surgery in those with severe hypothyroidism (i.e., thyroxine level <1 µg/dl) risks precipitating myxedema coma. Unmanaged hyperthyroidism carries a theoretical risk of thyroid storm during surgery. Surgery should be postponed in such patients. If surgery must be performed, then early endocrinology input is advised.
Patients with known adrenal insufficiency and those taking chronic high-dose steroids (i.e., >20 mg of prednisone daily for >3 weeks) are at risk of adrenal crisis during the perioperative period. Such patients should receive stress dose steroids (i.e., 100 mg hydrocortisone IV every 8 hours). This regimen should be initiated prior to surgery and as soon as possible in patients with significant surgical illness.
D. Patients with liver disease are at risk both from surgical procedures and from anesthesia. Elective surgery is considered contraindicated in those with acute hepatitis (both viral and alcoholic), severe chronic hepatitis, and advanced cirrhosis (i.e., Child-Pugh class C) as a result of unacceptably high rates of perioperative mortality. Patients with stable liver disease may proceed to surgery after careful assessment for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and encephalopathy.
E. When managing patients with renal failure, because thromboembolism is a significant cause of avoidable hospital morbidity and mortality, consultants should routinely recommend DVT prophylaxis with a heparinoid agent (i.e., unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin). Those at particularly high risk for DVT (e.g., spinal cord injury or general surgery in those with multiple risk factors) benefit from both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures. Nonpharmacologic measures to reduce the incidence of DVT include graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression. Note that aspirin alone is considered insufficient thromboprophylaxis for any category of surgical patient.
Patients should be routinely asked about alcohol intake and any prior symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Those deemed at risk should be placed on an alcohol withdrawal pathway. Such pathways use either symptom-driven scales or fixed-schedule dosing for benzodiazepine administration.
