A. It is increasingly common to find multiple small nodules on a CT scan that was done for other reasons. The initial evaluation should then include a comprehensive history and a physical examination. The history should focus on risks related to possible malignancy, infection, and underlying rheumatologic disease because these broad categories are responsible for the majority of these nodules. Specifically, determine whether the patient is immunocompromised because this broadens the differential greatly. Also explore recent exposures and recent travel. A past history of malignancy raises the possibility of metastatic disease, whereas associated symptoms of fever, weight loss, and night sweats may suggest lymphoma or infection.
B. As with a solitary pulmonary nodule, always seek out old radiographic images. Stability over months to years makes a benign process much more likely and rapid growth often favors infection. It should also be noted that with the increased use of CT scans, there are more patients who have multiple tiny (<5 mm) nodules. For the most part, in patients without high-risk factors, these can be followed with serial CT scans. Often, in a low-risk patient, one additional CT scan is all that is required.
C. If the history raises the concern for infectious etiologies, there are certain patterns on CT scan that suggest particular pathogens. Peripheral nodules, particularly those which cavitate, suggest septic emboli. Blood cultures and a search for a source of the emboli are appropriate. Lower lobe predominance is common with pulmonary abscesses, septic emboli, and infection with Paragonimus westermani. Whereas more common to cause a solitary pulmonary nodule, Dirofilaria (dog heartworm) can also cause multiple nodules. Multiple, small calcified nodules suggests prior granulomatous disease, including previous histoplasmosis infection or mycobacterial infection.
D. Other typical patterns include the “halo sign” of adjacent hemorrhage seen with angio-invasive aspergillosis and "tree-in-bud” changes of bronchiolitis classically seen with atypical mycobacterial infection. Innumerable, small nodules should make the physician consider miliary tuberculosis infection. Immunocompromised patients can present with nodules resulting from a variety of other organisms, including, but not limited to, nocardia, Pneumocystis, varicella, and other viruses. Also, common infections can present atypically in hosts with impaired immune systems, so the differential should be kept broad in this population. Sputum, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), serologies and more rarely a surgical lung biopsy may all play a role in determining a diagnosis.
E. In a patient with known malignancy, there should always be concern for metastatic disease presenting as multiple pulmonary nodules. Although many cancers can metastasize to the lung, certain types are more likely to do so. These include colon, breast, prostate, thyroid, renal, testicular, melanoma, and sarcoma. If the patient does not have known metastatic disease, it is reasonable to proceed with surgical biopsy of one of these lesions for guidance of future therapy.
F. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can present as multiple pulmonary nodules without associated lymphadenopathy. Primary lung cancer much more commonly presents as a solitary pulmonary nodule. That said, of the subtypes of lung cancer, bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma more often presents with multiple foci of disease. These lesions are often at least in part ground glass density on CT scan. If considering either lymphoma or lung cancer, a diagnosis should be aggressively pursued. Whereas a bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and bronchial washings can be a first step, most of these lesions require surgical biopsy.
G. A variety of rheumatologic diseases can present with pulmonary nodules but the most common is rheumatoid arthritis. Pulmonary nodules are more common when the patient also has cutaneous nodules and are found more often in men than in women. Although atypical, sarcoid can also present as nodules in the lungs.
H. There are a variety of miscellaneous causes of multiple pulmonary nodules, most of which are suggested by history. A patient with an exposure to silica, talc, or coal dust may present with large, upper lobe predominant nodules often on a background of fibrosis. Patients with a history of IV drug abuse may also present with multiple nodules, which are a result of an inflammatory response to the talc used to “cut" the illicit drug. A vessel leading into a nodule or a lobular contour to a nodule should suggest arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can be confirmed by CT or traditional angiography. If multiple AVMs are found, consider a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).
