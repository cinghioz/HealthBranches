A. Anorectal pain has several potential causes, including local and nonlocal disease processes. A careful history and physical examination, including neurologic, anoscopic, and pelvic examinations, are important in the search for a cause, which may range from an easily treated condition to a life-threatening one. Important considerations in the history are associated symptoms and reported signs (e.g., fever, rectal bleeding, vaginal discharge, hematuria, neurologic dysfunction). Also note rapid onset of symptoms, sexual practices, and any history of inflammatory bowel disease.
B. Careful inspection, along with digital and anoscopic examinations, reveals most local causes of anorectal pain, but further evaluation with proctosigmoidoscopy may be necessary. This also provides a means for obtaining biopsy specimens for culture and histology. Rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, diarrhea, and anorectal pain suggest proctitis from infection or other inflammatory causes.
C. A pelvic examination and consideration of pelvic ultrasonography or CT scan are important in the diagnosis of conditions that may cause referred pain to the anus and rectum. Most of these conditions have a common pathway of irritation of the pudendal nerves that supply sensory innervation to the anus and rectum. Cervical and vaginal cultures and urinalysis with culture are necessary when considering pelvic inflammatory disease, prostatitis, or nephrolithiasis. Consider CT-pyelography if the clinical picture is otherwise consistent with nephrolithiasis.
D. The diagnosis of proctalgia fugax rests on the history and the exclusion of other pelvic or anorectal abnormality. It is a benign condition of unknown cause characterized by paroxysmal anorectal pain of varying severity and sudden onset. Coccygodynia consists of throbbing or aching pain in the coccygeal region. Organic causes include fracture of the coccyx and traumatic arthritis of the sacrococcygeal joint. A functional coccygodynia also exists. Coccygeal tenderness associated with spasm of surrounding muscles is a common finding on physical examination. Tension myalgia of the pelvic floor describes a syndrome of chronic vague discomfort in the rectum, pelvis, or lower back in patients without any other definable cause of pain. Pain typically is constant. Some authorities believe that the pain may be related to poor posture, generalized deconditioning, and possible psychological disorders. Chronic idiopathic anal pain has features that overlap with the other chronic pain syndromes.
E. There are several neurologic causes of anorectal pain. Associated neurologic signs and symptoms, pain characteristics, onset of pain, and spinal pathology are important factors in considering a neurologic cause for rectal pain. After a careful neurologic examination the procedures listed will be helpful in diagnosis of a specific neurologic disorder. Formal neurology consultation is recommended.
F. Pain may originate in sacral spinal cord segments or sacral nerve roots. Neoplasm, abscess, or inflammatory processes of the conus medullaris may present with pain. Associated loss of bowel or bladder function often occurs.
G. Entrapment of the sacral nerve roots of the cauda equina may occur secondary to inflammatory reactions in the cerebrospinal fluid or they may be compressed by tumor, abscess, or lumbosacral disc herniation.
H. The sacral plexus is located against the posterior pelvic wall. The plexus may be compressed by tumor or enlarged lymph nodes. Consider CT or MRI of the sacral spine and pelvis.
I. Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rare cause of rectal pain. This is most commonly the result of vascular malformation rupture, but it may also be associated with trauma, anticoagulant therapy, blood dyscrasias, or tumor. Ependymoma is the most common tumor associated with spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In patients with sudden onset of rectal pain associated with back pain, headache, stiff neck, and fever, consider spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
