The choice of appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be based on several factors, including pathogens being treated, the antimicrobial spectrum, and a variety of patient-specific factors. Antibiotic choices should be based on a sound rationale.

A. Empiric therapy is based on a presumptive diagnosis of infection or clinical syndrome. Especially in the hospital setting, empiric therapy is broad in spectrum, designed to cover the most likely pathogens in the specific patient. Before initiating empiric therapy, obtain appropriate specimens for culture and sensitivity. Empiric therapy is indicated when the infection is potentially rapidly life-threatening (sepsis, pneumonia) or causes significant morbidity (urinary tract infection, severe dysentery). Therapy should be based on available evidence-based guidelines rather than drug manufacturer marketing and advertising.
B. The most likely pathogens at a site of infection may be based on normal flora at that site; tropism of certain pathogens for various tissues or organs; and patient-specific factors such as previous antimicrobial therapy, nosocomial versus community-acquired infection, and patient immune status. Not every possible pathogen requires coverageâ€”just those that are most likely. Emergence of drug resistance in common bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus and spread of these organisms to the community has made antibiotic decision making more complex. The clinician must know current local resistance patterns of common pathogens and factors driving increased resistance. The use of certain drugs, such as vancomycin and linezolid, should be based on strict guidelines to reduce the development and spread of resistance.
C. Patient-specific factors include history of previous adverse reactions to antimicrobials, patient age, pregnancy or lactation, concomitant drugs, excretory organ function, immune status, and site of infection. For patients who are very ill, IV administration is preferable to ensure adequate drug concentrations at the site of infection.
D. Combination therapy is indicated when broad-spectrum coverage is desired (sepsis), in polymicrobial infections (intraperitoneal abscesses), to prevent the emergence of resistance (tuberculosis), or to provide antimicrobial synergy (streptococcal endocarditis, B-lactam/aminoglycoside for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, amphotericin/5-flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis).
E. The cost of drug therapy is based not only on the drug cost but on the cost of administration, supplies, and monitoring. If all else is equal, choose the least expensive regimen. However, therapeutic efficacy is of primary importance.
F. Definitive therapy occurs when a microbiologic and a clinical diagnosis are confirmed. Definitive therapy is narrow in spectrum and generally requires only one drug. If the patient was previously receiving empiric therapy, determine the need for continued treatment.
G. Susceptibility data are useful in determining definitive therapy, but there are pitfalls. If the reported susceptibilities do not fit usual patterns for that organism, the reliability of the information is suspect. If minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are present, in general, any drug in the sensitive MIC range will be effective. Some forms of antibiotic resistance may not be detected by standard laboratory methodology.
H. Even with positive cultures, broad-spectrum therapy may be indicated, especially in patients who are immunosuppressed. Base the choice of antimicrobial regimen on clinical judgment and laboratory data.
I. A variety of drug-specific factors must be considered. Certain agents do not penetrate well into certain tissues (e.g., aminoglycosides in CNS infections, vancomycin in pulmonary infections). If a relatively new antimicrobial is considered, there should be clinical trials documenting efficacy compared with the conventional regimen for that infection. Consider drug toxicity; reserve more toxic drugs (aminoglycosides, amphotericin B) for patients at higher risk.
J. If the patient is not critically ill and has adequate GI tract function, give oral antimicrobials as soon as possible. However, in some cases, long-term or home IV antimicrobial therapy is indicated if oral agents are not available for the specific infection.
