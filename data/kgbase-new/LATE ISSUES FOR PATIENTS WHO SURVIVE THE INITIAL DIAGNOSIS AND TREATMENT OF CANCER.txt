Although modern therapy has produced a significant improvement in the rate of control and cure of cancer, the devastation of the disease and its treatment have lasting effects on both patients and family. Successful treatment of patients with cancer requires not only technical expertise in the initial phase of diagnosis and management, but also compassion and commitment in the long term to aid the patient and his or her family in navigating the many complex issues and challenges they will face for years to come.Following initial cancer therapy, patients and their families will face ongoing needs and issues in five main areas: the potential for relapse of the initial cancer, the physical and physiologic effects of the cancer and its treatment both short and long term, the psychological and emotional sequelae of the disease itself and its treatment, the specific potential for shared genetic risk for cancer development in blood relatives, and the potential for the late development of new cancers, including those that may themselves be a consequence of initial therapy.Relapse of the primary cancer will be a major concern for patients in the years following initial diagnosis and treatment. A periodic history and physical examination are the key focuses of follow-up and should be coordinated with a cancer specialist, at least during the early phase. In selected malignancies, focused radiologic or laboratory studies will be important, such as mammograms in the follow-up of breast cancer and serial monitoring of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment for prostate cancer, but for most malignancies repetitive performance of “surveillance” blood and radiologic studies has little additional impact on survival and quality of life while adding significantly to expense. In contrast, prompt and rigorous laboratory and radiologic evaluation of new symptoms or physical findings is key to successful early intervention for possible relapse. For most malignancies, patients should be followed on an interval of every 3 months for 2–3 years after completion of initial successful treatment for cancer. The interval for follow-up can be lengthened thereafter if the patient remains stable. Specific timelines for follow-up and selected ancillary studies that have proved valuable are described for individual cancer diagnoses in the guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org).Even when successful, cancer treatment can leave devastating scars and result in significant short- and long-term dysfunction. Radical surgical procedures result in obvious physical effects; radical radiation can produce equally significant scarring in the short term and later endocrine or neurologic dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis, or secondary malignancies, as discussed later. Chemotherapy may produce a wide spectrum or early and late organ dysfunction, including immune dysregulation, premature menopause, cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, alterations of renal or hepatic function, neuropathy, or skin pigmentation changes depending on the agents used and dose and duration of therapy. In pediatric populations, intensive cancer therapy may have significant effects on subsequent growth and development.Interrelated with but sometimes independent of the physical and physiologic effects of cancer therapy, the psychological and emotional consequences are obvious but often persistent well beyond apparently successful initial therapy. Changes in body image, fear of disease relapse, altered interpersonal relationships, disruption of education or career paths, and ongoing alteration of physical capacity may all dramatically and permanently affect cancer survivors. Family members may be equally or even more significantly affected. Although the acute phase of cancer treatment typically includes an extensive framework for psychological and emotional support and therapy, there may be barriers to access to such support following completion of the initial phase of therapy, particularly for patients who find it difficult to return to the setting that reminds them of the trauma of their initial care.With the characterization of cancer as a disease resulting from alteration of normal genetic programs, it is now possible to explain the clustering of cancers in certain families on the basis of a shared germline mutation placing those families at higher risk. Beyond the many issues described previously that patients must face, they are increasingly aware of and concerned about the potential that they may have transmitted a higher risk for cancer to their children or that they share that risk with other family members. A family cancer syndrome should be particularly suspected when cancer appears in multiple family members or affects particularly young individuals (those <40 years of age). Specific algorithms for genetic counseling, testing, and preemptive intervention have been developed for families with premature or clusters of breast, colon, and ovarian cancer but should be pursued in conjunction with an established genetics clinic.Cancer survivors are at risk not only for the relapse of their primary malignancy but also of additional and independent malignancies in the years following their diagnosis. The same risk factors that led to the first cancer leave patients at risk for the development of independent cancers of the same organ later, particularly for breast, lung, and head and neck malignancies, with continued tobacco exposure particularly exacerbating that risk in the latter two. Chemotherapy and radiation may also produce secondary malignancies that develop because of the treatment itself. Genetic damage induced by irradiation or by certain classes of chemotherapeutic agents sets into motion a new sequence of cellular degeneration and transformation producing acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and virtually the entire spectrum of solid malignancies complicating the late course of cancer treatment. Certain patients, particularly those with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute leukemia, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumor, soft-tissue sarcoma, and testicular malignancies, seem to be at particular risk.
