Liver aminotransferases include aspartate aminotransferase (AST, formerly SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, formerly SGPT). They actively participate in the process of gluconeogenesis as mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes within the hepatocyte. Other liver biochemical enzymes include alkaline phosphatase (canalicular membrane), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (hepatocyte and biliary epithelia), and 5'-nucleotidase (sinusoidal and canalicular membrane). Abnormally increased serum liver enzymes are reported in approximately 0.5%-4% of the asymptomatic population, usually when routine health screening testing is performed. The first step when evaluating a patient with increased liver biochemistries is to assess the degree of abnormality. If those are minimal (usually 2–5 times the upper limit of the reference range), retesting is necessary to avoid excessive and expensive workup. Of significance is that reference laboratory values are defined as the mean of the distribution ± 2 standard deviations of the normal population. Therefore, there will always be a subset of asymptomatic patients (2.5% above and 2.5% below the reference range) without any demonstrable cause of minimally “abnormal” liver chemistries. However, patients with underlying chronic liver disease may have fluctuating levels of “normal” serum liver biochemistries throughout the course of their disease. Physiologic states can also lead to elevated liver enzymes (e.g., pregnancy induces elevation of alkaline phosphatase). A. If a significant abnormal pattern is detected, use the diagnostic clues to guide further testing. During the initial evaluation, review patient symptoms; risk factors for liver disease (alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, tattoos, history of blood transfusions, sexual history); associated morbid conditions (diabetes or glucose intolerance, obesity, dyslipidemia); medications (including herbal/alternative and over-the-counter medications); and family history. Perform a thorough physical examination. Look for stigmata of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomas, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and Duputyren's contractures during physical examination. B. The clinical significance of any liver chemistry test abnormality must be interpreted in the context of each clinical setting. Generally, these abnormalities can be further categorized into three main groups: hepatocellular injury predominance (AST/ALT), associated cholestasis (increased alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin), and/or associated impaired metabolic/synthetic liver function (low albumin, prolonged prothrombin time [PT]). Specific ratios and levels of serum AST to ALT may be useful in differential diagnosis. For example, in most forms of acute liver injury this ratio is ≤1, whereas in alcoholic hepatitis it is typically >2. Elevation of these enzymes >1000 U/L suggests ongoing acute viral, drug, or ischemic insult to the liver. Epidemiologic factors help guide further evaluation and management. Worldwide, viral hepatitides are the most common causes of abnormal liver transaminases. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is also frequent. Therefore, initial testing for mildly elevated aminotransferases must include serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses as well as fasting iron (Fe) studies (serum ferritin and iron saturation). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) unfortunately has no specific serologic test available, and it is increasing in frequency. Risk factors for fatty liver include the presence of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus. C. If hepatitis serologies and iron studies are normal, serum ceruloplasmin and alpha-1-antitrypsin should be measured to screen for Wilson's disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency disorders, respectively. Chronic autoimmune hepatitis can be another less common cause of liver AST/ALT elevation. It occurs predominantly in women and is often associated with thyroiditis and other autoimmune disorders. Serum serologic markers to screen for autoimmune hepatitis include antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth-muscle antibody (Ab), and potentially liver kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody. Other hepatotropic viruses (concomitant hepatitis E and D, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and herpes) or infiltrating liver disease (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, amyloidosis, fungal infection, and lymphomas) can be a cause for elevated aminotransferases. Uncommon nonhepatic causes for abnormal transaminases include thyroid disease, muscle disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, and strenuous exercise. When the alkaline phosphatase is also found to be abnormally elevated, hepatobiliary or nonhepatic origin should be differentiated. Serum assays of 5'-nucleotidase or gamma glutamyl transferase are generally used to confirm or exclude a liver-specific origin. Once confirmed, liver imaging studies are recommended to complete initial evaluation. Radiologic tests available include ultrasonography (US), CT, radionuclide scans, and MRI. For biliary obstruction or parenchymal disease, US or CT are included as a part of the initial evaluation. If a primary or metastatic liver malignancy is suspected, a triple-phase CT of the liver is recommended. For the detection of intrahepatic vascular lesions, a nuclear scan or MRI of the liver is necessary. Finally, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an effective noninvasive imaging technique to evaluate biliary ductal anatomy. D. Liver biopsy provides important prognostic and diagnostic information in patients with liver disease. However, it should be performed only if the expected results exceed the low risks of the procedure. In patients with chronically elevated (>6 months) liver enzymes or with impaired hepatic function, liver biopsy should be considered. Recent studies have shown that the most likely diagnosis is steatosis and steatohepatitis when biopsy is performed for abnormal liver chemistries with unremarkable serologies.
