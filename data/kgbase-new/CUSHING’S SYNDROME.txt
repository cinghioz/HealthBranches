Cushing's syndrome is characterized by hypercortisolemia that can be adrenal in origin or can result from a pituitary adenoma secreting adrenocorticotropin. The clinical features are diverse and are related to the severity of the hypercortisolemia; no symptom or sign is specific. The most common presenting feature is obesity of the face, neck, and abdomen that spares the extremities. Facial fat deposition can result in a “moon” face exacerbated by deposition of fat in the supraclavicular fat pads, which makes the neck appear shortened. These patients develop skin thinning, atrophy, and easy bruising. Striae typical of Cushing's syndrome are typically purple in color, wide, and multiple, factors that help distinguish them from stretch marks associated with obesity. Women with Cushing's disease may have signs of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism. Proximal myopathy (usually described as difficulty rising from a seated position), psychiatric change (emotional lability, depression, and mild paranoia are common), and hypertension are often at present. Other features associated with longer-standing or more severe hypercortisolemia include glucose intolerance, glaucoma, and osteopenia.

A. The first step in evaluating whether a patient may have Cushing's syndrome is to elucidate any history of exposure to corticosteroids, including potent inhaled, injected, or topical steroids, or medroxyprogesterone acetate (a progestin with intrinsic steroid activity). Factitious Cushing's syndrome accounts for <1% of all cases and is suggested by erratic and inconsistent results. In such cases, synthetic glucocorticoids can be assayed directly in the urine.
B. To establish hypercortisolemia, at least two 24-hour urine samples for free cortisol should be obtained. Patients whose levels are greater than three times higher than the upper reference range can be assumed to have Cushing's syndrome. Patients with equivocal values should be retested after a few weeks or evaluated with further testing according to the clinical suspicion.
C. An overnight dexamethasone suppression test is also used as a screening test to diagnose hypercortisolemia. In this test, an 8-AM serum cortisol level is drawn after a 1-mg dexamethasone dose at 11 PM-midnight. The sensitivity and specificity of the test for Cushing's syndrome varies widely depending on the threshold level chosen. Most normal patients should suppress their endogenous cortisol level to <2 µg/dl. Using a level of 6.3 µg/dl, the test has a sensitivity and a specificity of 91%. For a level of 1.2 µg/dl, the corresponding values were 100% and 41%.
A screening strategy that uses three consecutive late-evening salivary cortisols and may ultimately replace these aforementioned tests can be performed with minimal instruction by a patient who is ambulatory. Reference ranges are laboratory specific. The sensitivity may be as high as 100% and the specificity may be as high as 96% among patients with Cushing's syndrome.
D. Some conditions, such as severe obesity, severe depression, or chronic alcoholism, are associated with elevated cortisol levels, a circumstance labeled “pseudo-Cushing’s.” Among patients in whom a diagnosis of pseudo-Cushing’s is suspected, a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)–dexamethasone test can be preformed. This test capitalizes on the finding that the pituitary is less responsive to CRH among patients who are depressed than among patients with Cushing's disease or syndrome after dexamethasone suppression. Ovine CRH is usually infused 2 hours after the last dose of a series of 8 doses of 0.5 mg dexamethasone given every 6 hours. Serum cortisol is measured at 0, 15, and 30 minutes. In one series, all patients with a level <1.4 µg/dl in the 15-minute sample had pseudo-Cushing’s; all other patients responded with higher cortisol levels.
Once the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is secure, a source for the hypercortisolemia should be sought. Determining whether Cushing's syndrome is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) dependent or adrenal in origin requires accurate measurement of ACTH levels. It is possible to expedite the evaluation process by measuring ACTH and cortisol levels on the morning following a dexamethasone-suppression test or on completion of one or more collections for urinary-free cortisol.
E. Cortisol secretion can be deemed ACTH independent if the ACTH is <5 pg/ml when the cortisol level is <15 µg/dl. Under the same circumstances, the syndrome is very likely to be ACTH dependent (Cushing's disease) if the ACTH level is >15 pg/ml when the cortisol is ≥15 µg/dl; ACTH levels of between 5 and 15 pg/ml are less specific but usually indicate ACTH dependency. Patients with equivocal values should be reinvestigated.
