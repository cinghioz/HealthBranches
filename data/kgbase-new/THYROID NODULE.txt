In the United States, between 4% and 7% of the adult population have a palpable thyroid nodule. Only 5% of these are malignant. Other causes of nodules include thyroid cyst, a colloid nodule, a focal area of thyroiditis, and a benign follicular neoplasm. Nodules can be solitary or multiple. The risk of cancer is not lower when nodules are multiple.
A. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is performed. A suppressed TSH level suggests a benign hyperfunctioning nodule. Hyperfunctioning nodules are so rarely malignant that if the TSH is suppressed, fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be deferred. A normal or high TSH level does not obviate the need for further investigation.
B. Perform clinical evaluation. High-risk features include rapid tumor growth, regional lymphadenopathy, a firm or hard nodule, and a family history of thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia. Risk increases more moderately with the following features: age younger than 20 years or older than 70 years; male gender; a history of head and neck irradiation; a nodule >4 cm; or the presence of local symptoms such as dysphagia, hoarseness, or cough. Patients with at least two high-risk features should be referred for surgical management.
C. FNA with ultrasonography can be performed in the office and increases the sensitivity and specificity of the FNA result (Marqusee, 2000). Ultrasonography can detect high-risk features such as hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular margins, increased vascularity by Doppler, and evidence of local lymphadenopathy.
Patients undergoing FNA do not typically need to stop taking aspirin or anticoagulants. The procedure is safe and well tolerated. Each lesion >1 cm in size should be sampled with two to four passes of the needle.
Cystic nodules can be drained after any solid portion is aspirated, although most recur; use of sclerosants such as ethanol and tetracycline has been disappointing.
D. Radionucleotide scanning uses iodine-123, iodine-131, or technetium-99m-pertechnetate to detect whether a nodule is functioning. A scan can also determine whether a nodule is dominant within a multinodular gland or retrosternal. A scan cannot accurately determine the size of a thyroid nodule.
E. Benign nodules can remain in situ. Repeat ultrasonography after 9-12 months to ensure that there has been no significant change in size is suggested. Levothyroxine suppression is no longer recommended because TSH must be suppressed to <0.1 mU/L to effectively suppress nodular growth or formation and suppression to this level is associated with an increased risk of bone loss and atrial fibrillation.
F. Follicular neoplasm may be benign or malignant because cellular aspirates cannot distinguish these two. If the patient prefers, or if the nodule is cold on radionuclide scanning, then excision is recommended.
G. Malignant nodules should be excised with a total thyroidectomy and usually require postoperative thyroid ablation with iodine-131. Disease recurrence can be screened for using thyroglobulin measurements.
H. Nondiagnostic aspirates occur about 10% of the time. If a second sample is again nondiagnostic, then referral for surgical excision is appropriate.
