Diarrhea is defined as the passage of stool with liquid consistency and weight >200 g/day. It becomes chronic when symptoms persist for >4 weeks.
The common pathophysiologic mechanism of diarrhea is an incomplete absorption of water from the lumen. This can occur in several ways, such as reduced rate of net water absorption (abnormal electrolyte secretion), intraluminal osmotic water retention (osmotic load), decreased mucosal surface area, and abnormalities in intestinal motility. Several classifications for the clinician guide the evaluation of diarrhea. A practical and widely used approach to facilitate the diagnosis is based on stool characteristics. Chronic diarrhea is then subdivided into watery, inflammatory, or fatty in nature.
A. A detailed medical history is essential for the evaluation of chronic diarrhea. It is important to differentiate functional from organic disorders. A functional etiology may be suggested in the absence of significant unintentional weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, or persistence of symptoms for >1 year. Onset of symptoms, specific patterns, duration, and aggravating/alleviating factors should always be investigated. It is also essential to inquire about a previous history of radiation therapy, prior abdominal surgery, and antibiotic or other medication use because these are common causes of iatrogenic diarrhea. Medication use has been described as the causative factor in up to 4% of patients with chronic diarrhea. The clinician should elicit a history of specific stool characteristics such as the presence of blood, mucus, oil droplets, or undigested food particles. Other coexisting symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, fever, excessive flatulence, and bloating, should be further investigated. Other systemic illnesses such as AIDS, diabetes, and thyroid and collagen vascular diseases may play a contributory role in patients with chronic diarrhea. Dietary habits and the presence of food additives (sorbitol, mannitol, and fructose) should also be discussed. Recent travel, sexual history, occupation, source of drinking water, and alcohol or illicit drug abuse are other pertinent pieces of information in the history.
B. On physical examination, prompt determination of the severity of symptoms is mandatory and is initially more important than obtaining a specific diagnosis. A good place to start is to evaluate the patient's intravascular volume status. If detected, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances should be addressed and corrected immediately. A careful abdominal examination should be performed, noting absence or presence of abdominal sounds, bruits, fluid, organomegaly, or palpable masses. A rectal examination may reveal pelvic or sphincter dysfunction. The physical examination can also help in identifying systemic causes of diarrhea such as right-sided heart murmurs, enlarged hard liver and flushing (carcinoid), arthritis (inflammatory bowel disease, Whipple's, and other enteric infections), dermatitis herpetiformis (celiac sprue), and pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum (inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]).
C. Routine laboratory studies should be obtained as part of the initial evaluation. These include a CBC, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and a screen for celiac disease. Other studies are also complementary to initial testing. Stool analysis is crucial in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea. These samples can be obtained in a random sample or a timed collection.
• 24- to 48-hour collection samples are preferred so that stool volume, weight, and different components can be accurately measured.
• Fecal leukocytes and lactoferrin (iron-binding glycoprotein) are important diagnostic tools for detecting inflammatory diarrhea. This can be secondary to an infectious cause, IBD, or microscopic colitis.
• Fecal occult blood testing is nonspecific. The utility of this test for detecting inflammatory and neoplastic pathology in chronic diarrhea has not been established. Conditions such as celiac sprue, small bowel lymphoma, and refractory sprue have been associated with positive guaiac results.
• Stool fat is used to determine the presence of steatorrhea, which is defined as a loss of fat in stool >7 g or 9% of fat intake in 24 hours. A minimal consumption of 70-100 g of fat per day is mandatory for quantitative studies. Fat excretion >14 g per day is strongly suggestive of fat malabsorption. A qualitative Sudan III stain test can predict 90% of patients with clinically significant steatorrhea.
• Stool osmotic gap is used to differentiate an osmotic from a secretory type of diarrhea. This is determined by the electrolyte concentration in the stool water, using the following formula: 290 - 2(Na + K). If the osmotic gap is small (<50), unabsorbed electrolytes retain water in the lumen, which is characteristic of secretory diarrhea. However, if the osmotic gap is large (>125), the nonelectrolyte content in the lumen is accounted for by the retained water, being more consistent with an osmotic diarrhea.
