Patient with Suspected SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION,Initiate treatment based on findings,"Evaluate patient history and perform physical examination -> Physical examination: Pain, Tenderness, Weakness, Sensory, Abnormal deep tendon reflexes -> Obtain plain radiographs of the spine -> MRI/Myelography -> Negative, Pain present -> Perform Myelography -> Initiate treatment based on findings"
Patient with Suspected SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION,Monitor patient's condition and response to treatment,"Evaluate patient history and perform physical examination -> Physical examination: Pain, Tenderness, Weakness, Sensory, Abnormal deep tendon reflexes -> Obtain plain radiographs of the spine -> MRI/Myelography -> Negative, Pain present -> Perform Myelography -> Monitor patient's condition and response to treatment"
Patient with Suspected SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION,Administer steroids and initiate radiotherapy,"Evaluate patient history and perform physical examination -> Physical examination: Pain, Tenderness, Weakness, Sensory, Abnormal deep tendon reflexes -> Obtain plain radiographs of the spine -> MRI/Myelography -> Positive -> Administer steroids and initiate radiotherapy"
Patient with Suspected SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION,Evaluate the need for surgical intervention,"Evaluate patient history and perform physical examination -> Physical examination: Pain, Tenderness, Weakness, Sensory, Abnormal deep tendon reflexes -> Obtain plain radiographs of the spine -> MRI/Myelography -> Positive, Neurologic progression, Previous radiotherapy, No histologic diagnosis -> Evaluate the need for surgical intervention"
Patient with Suspected SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION,Treat the patient based on MRI findings,"Evaluate patient history and perform physical examination -> Physical examination: Pain, Tenderness, Weakness, Sensory, Abnormal deep tendon reflexes -> Obtain plain radiographs of the spine -> Negative -> Adjust pain medications as needed -> If pain persists with tenderness or if the history is highly suspicious -> Perform MRI -> Treat the patient based on MRI findings"
