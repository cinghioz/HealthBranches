HIV-Positive Patient with Suspected CNS INFECTION,Consider performing a brain biopsy to determine the cause,"Algorithm for diagnosing and managing CNS infections in HIV-positive patients -> History, physical and detailed-neurologic examination -> Patient presents with focal neurological signs, seizures, or altered mental status -> Perform a CT scan to assess for lesions -> CT scan reveals a lesion -> Mass effect -> Administer empiric steroids -> Patient has positive Toxoplasma serology and is not receiving prophylaxis -> Empiric Toxoplasma therapy -> No improvement after 10-14 days of empiric therapy -> Consider performing a brain biopsy to determine the cause||Algorithm for diagnosing and managing CNS infections in HIV-positive patients -> History, physical and detailed-neurologic examination -> Patient presents with focal neurological signs, seizures, or altered mental status -> Perform a CT scan to assess for lesions -> CT scan reveals a lesion -> Mass effect -> Administer empiric steroids -> CSF findings suggest lymphoma, or patient has negative Toxoplasma serology, is receiving prophylaxis, or has other risk factors for different conditions -> Consider performing a brain biopsy to determine the cause"
