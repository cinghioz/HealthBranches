Hematuria,"Isolated glomerular hematuria: Normal renal function, No proteinuria. Differential diagnosis: IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane, hereditary nephritis. Biopsy not indicated","Patient with Hematuria -> Heme-positive urine dipstick: Confirm by microscopic examination. False positive: <3 RBCs/hpf, free myoglobin, free hemoglobin -> Laboratory evaluation: Renal function tests, CBC with PT, PTT, Examination of urinary sediment -> Quantification of protein excretion. PCR >0.3 and/or ≥300 mg/24 hr suggests glomerular origin -> Glomerular source: RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs -> Isolated glomerular hematuria: Normal renal function, No proteinuria. Differential diagnosis: IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane, hereditary nephritis. Biopsy not indicated"
