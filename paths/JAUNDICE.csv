Patient with JAUNDICE,Proceed with therapeutic intervention based on ERCP or THC findings,"Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Biliary tract obstruction is a consideration -> Perform abdominal ultrasound or CT scan -> Presence of dilated bile ducts -> Biliary obstruction confirmed -> Perform ERCP or THC for further evaluation and treatment -> Proceed with therapeutic intervention based on ERCP or THC findings||Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine the clinical likelihood of biliary obstruction based on imaging results -> High likelihood of biliary obstruction -> Presence of dilated bile ducts -> Biliary obstruction confirmed -> Perform ERCP or THC for further evaluation and treatment -> Proceed with therapeutic intervention based on ERCP or THC findings"
Patient with JAUNDICE,Biliary obstruction is ruled out,"Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Biliary tract obstruction is a consideration -> Perform abdominal ultrasound or CT scan -> Absence of dilated bile ducts -> Biliary obstruction is ruled out||Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine the clinical likelihood of biliary obstruction based on imaging results -> Low likelihood of biliary obstruction -> Absence of dilated bile ducts -> Biliary obstruction is ruled out"
Patient with JAUNDICE,Observe the patient and consider a liver biopsy if necessary,"Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Biliary tract obstruction is a consideration -> Assess whether biliary tract obstruction is a possibility -> Alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are not elevated -> Perform biochemical studies to identify specific causes of liver disease -> Observe the patient and consider a liver biopsy if necessary||Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are not elevated -> Perform biochemical studies to identify specific causes of liver disease -> Observe the patient and consider a liver biopsy if necessary"
Patient with JAUNDICE,Evaluate the patient for hemolysis or hereditary hyperbilirubinemia,"Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Biliary tract obstruction is a consideration -> Assess whether biliary tract obstruction is a possibility -> Alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are not elevated -> Evaluate the patient for hemolysis or hereditary hyperbilirubinemia||Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine if alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are elevated -> Alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferases are not elevated -> Evaluate the patient for hemolysis or hereditary hyperbilirubinemia"
Patient with JAUNDICE,Consider performing MRCP or EUS for further evaluation,"Evaluation of a patient presenting with jaundice -> Initial assessment including patient history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests -> Determine the clinical likelihood of biliary obstruction based on imaging results -> Intermediate likelihood of biliary obstruction -> Consider performing MRCP or EUS for further evaluation"
