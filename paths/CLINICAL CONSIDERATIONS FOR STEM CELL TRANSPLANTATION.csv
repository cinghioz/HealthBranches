Appropriate transfusion strategy and timing of transplant -> Age, organ function, and infectious disease screening of potential candidates. Psychosocial, dental, and fertility evaluations -> Potential transplant candidate -> Determine type of transplant -> Allogeneic transplant indicated -> Evaluate for sibling, registry, or cord blood cell sources matched for HLA-A, B, C, DR, DQ. Screen donor/donor cells for suitability. Awareness of ABO, allosensitization, CMV -> Appropriate GVHD therapy -> Immediate posttransplant support focused on transfusion, infection, and mucositis issues.
