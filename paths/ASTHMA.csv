Patient with ASTHMA,Short-acting beta agonist (albuterol),"Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> FEV1/FVC <70% or response to bronchodilator -> Initiate therapy -> Short-acting beta agonist (albuterol)"
Patient with ASTHMA,Steroid inhaler or leukotriene modifier,"Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> FEV1/FVC <70% or response to bronchodilator -> Initiate therapy -> Steroid inhaler or leukotriene modifier"
Patient with ASTHMA,"Long-acting beta agonist, theophylline, or anti-IgE therapy","Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> FEV1/FVC <70% or response to bronchodilator -> Initiate therapy -> Long-acting beta agonist, theophylline, or anti-IgE therapy"
Patient with ASTHMA,Consider referral to pulmonologist,"Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> FEV1/FVC <70% or response to bronchodilator -> Initiate therapy -> Consider referral to pulmonologist"
Patient with ASTHMA,"Environmental controls, smoking cessation, and action plan","Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> FEV1/FVC <70% or response to bronchodilator -> Environmental controls, smoking cessation, and action plan"
Patient with ASTHMA,Supports diagnosis of Asthma,"Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> Peak flow is normal -> Peak flow monitoring -> Peak flow shows 20% variability -> Supports diagnosis of Asthma||Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> Peak flow is normal -> Methacholine challenge -> Supports diagnosis of Asthma"
Patient with ASTHMA,Seek alternative diagnosis,"Evaluate patient with potential asthma -> Complete history, including triggers, history of atopy, and family history of atopy -> Physical examination, checking for nasal polyps, cobblestoning, and wheezing or stridor -> Spirometry with bronchodilator testing -> Peak flow is normal -> Methacholine challenge -> Rules out asthma -> Seek alternative diagnosis"
