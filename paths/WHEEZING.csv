Patient with wheezing,"Normal FEV1/FVC: Asthma, Postnasal drip, GERD, Vocal cord dysfunction, PE, ILD","Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Normal -> Spirometry -> Normal FEV1/FVC: Asthma, Postnasal drip, GERD, Vocal cord dysfunction, PE, ILD"
Patient with wheezing,"Decreased FEV1/FVC: Asthma, COPD, Bronchitis, Bronchiectasis, Cystic fibrosis","Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Normal -> Spirometry -> Decreased FEV1/FVC: Asthma, COPD, Bronchitis, Bronchiectasis, Cystic fibrosis"
Patient with wheezing,"Fever/sputum production: Bacterial pneumonia, Viral wheeze","Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Infiltrate -> Fever/sputum production: Bacterial pneumonia, Viral wheeze"
Patient with wheezing,"No fever present: Drug induced, Atypical pneumonitis, PE, Aspiration","Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Infiltrate -> No fever present: Drug induced, Atypical pneumonitis, PE, Aspiration"
Patient with wheezing,Treatment of CHF,Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Pulmonary edema -> Treatment of CHF
Patient with wheezing,"Diagnostic evaluation: Bronchoscopy, VATS, CT-guided biopsy","Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> Mass or obstructive lesion -> CT scan -> Diagnostic evaluation: Bronchoscopy, VATS, CT-guided biopsy"
Patient with wheezing,CT scan (with contrast if concern for PE),Determine degree of respiratory compromise -> Wheezing on physical examination -> Stable respiratory status -> Chest x-ray -> PE or ILD considered -> CT scan (with contrast if concern for PE)
