Polycythemia Suspected,Manage by addressing diuretic use or other volume-reducing factors,Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates decreased plasma volume -> Spurious polycythemia -> Manage by addressing diuretic use or other volume-reducing factors
Polycythemia Suspected,Treat underlying hypoxia,Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> Suggests secondary polycythemia due to hypoxia -> Secondary polycythemia hypoxia -> Treat underlying hypoxia
Polycythemia Suspected,"Hepatoma, cerebellar hemangioma, fibroma, pheochromocytoma","Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests a secondary cause -> Evaluate for potential sources of increased EPO production -> Hepatoma, cerebellar hemangioma, fibroma, pheochromocytoma"
Polycythemia Suspected,Evaluate for structural hemoglobin disorders,Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests a secondary cause -> Evaluate hemoglobin binding characteristics -> Indicates hemoglobinopathy or altered oxygen transport -> Evaluate for structural hemoglobin disorders
Polycythemia Suspected,Assess for carbon monoxide exposure,Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests a secondary cause -> Evaluate hemoglobin binding characteristics -> Indicates hemoglobinopathy or altered oxygen transport -> Assess for carbon monoxide exposure
Polycythemia Suspected,"Palpable spleen, normal O2 saturation, increased RBC mass","Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests autonomous erythropoiesis -> Apply Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria -> Palpable spleen, normal O2 saturation, increased RBC mass"
Polycythemia Suspected,"Increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, WBC, or platelets; increased B12 or B12-binding capacity; bone marrow biopsy findings; low EPO","Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests autonomous erythropoiesis -> Apply Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria -> Increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, WBC, or platelets; increased B12 or B12-binding capacity; bone marrow biopsy findings; low EPO"
Polycythemia Suspected,Initiate treatment as per clinical guidelines,Polycythemia Suspected -> Increased plasma hemoglobin -> Indicates true polycythemia -> Evaluate arterial blood gases -> O2 saturation >90% -> Evaluate erythropoietin (EPO) levels -> Suggests autonomous erythropoiesis -> Apply Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria -> Confirm polycythemia vera -> Initiate treatment as per clinical guidelines
