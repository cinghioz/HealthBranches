Noncardiac Chest Pain,Treat the patient for gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient responds to PPI treatment -> Treat the patient for gastroesophageal reflux disease||Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Conduct 24-hour pH monitoring -> Chest pain correlates with low pH -> Esophageal cause, likely GERD -> Treat the patient for gastroesophageal reflux disease"
Noncardiac Chest Pain,Treat based on the specific motility disorder,"Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> Abnormality found during endoscopy -> Treat based on the specific motility disorder||Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Conduct 24-hour pH monitoring -> pH levels are normal -> Perform manometry -> Manometry results are normal or show a nonspecific motility disorder -> Perform provocative testing (Bernstein, Tensilar, Balloon Distention) -> Chest pain induced during provocative testing -> Esophageal cause of chest pain is likely -> Treat based on the specific motility disorder||Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Conduct 24-hour pH monitoring -> pH levels are normal -> Perform manometry -> Specific motility disorders found -> Treat based on the specific motility disorder"
Noncardiac Chest Pain,Reassure the patient,Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Esophageal cause of chest pain is unlikely -> Reassure the patient
Noncardiac Chest Pain,Consider a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant,Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Esophageal cause of chest pain is unlikely -> Consider a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant
Noncardiac Chest Pain,Initiate an empiric trial of treatment for GERD,"Patient with noncardiac chest pain and normal coronary arteries -> Initial assessment of the patient -> Administer a double dose of proton pump inhibitor twice daily for 14 days -> Patient does not respond to PPI treatment -> Perform an endoscopy -> No pain induced during provocative testing -> Conduct 24-hour pH monitoring -> Low pH but not correlated with chest pain -> Possible esophageal cause, consider GERD -> Initiate an empiric trial of treatment for GERD"
