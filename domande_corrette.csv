After excluding common causes of fat malabsorption, what is the MOST appropriate next step in evaluating her diarrhea?",Secretin stimulation test,"['Lactose tolerance test', 'Secretin stimulation test', 'Trial of antibiotics', 'Small bowel biopsy', 'Colonoscopy']",B,"Chronic diarrhea with steatorrhea in a Crohn’s patient → When common causes are excluded, evaluate pancreatic exocrine function via a secretin stimulation test",Chronic diarrhea,0,No modification.
506,"A 54-year-old male presents with chronic diarrhea for the past 6 months. Stool analysis reveals high fat content, suggesting steatorrhea. After ensuring adequate dietary fat intake, what is the MOST appropriate next step in evaluating the cause of his fatty diarrhea?",Bentiromide test,"['Fecal calprotectin', 'Upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies', 'Bentiromide test', 'Trial of antibiotics', 'Colonoscopy']",C,"Chronic steatorrhea with adequate dietary fat intake → To assess pancreatic exocrine function, the bentiromide test is indicated",Chronic diarrhea,0,No modification.
