pathologic fractures,"The correct answer is **(B)**. Here's why:* **Pathologic fracture:** This means the bone broke due to an underlying disease, not just from trauma. In a 72-year-old with normal bone density, this strongly suggests metastasis (cancer spreading to the bone).* **Bisphosphonate therapy:** These medications help slow bone breakdown and can strengthen weakened bones, potentially reducing further fracture risk.Let's look at why the other options are less appropriate:* **(A) Observation and pain management:** While important, this alone doesn't address the underlying cause of the fracture",D,A 72-year-old male presents with a pathologic fracture in his femur following a minor fall.

respiratory symptoms in hiv-infected patients,"The correct answer is **(B) Tuberculosis (TB)**. Here's why:* **CD4 Count:** While a CD4 count of 400 cells/mL is not severely immunosuppressed, it's still below the healthy range. This makes opportunistic infections more likely.* **Subacute Onset:**Tuberculosis often presents with a gradual onset of symptoms like fever, cough, and shortness of breath.* **Focal Infiltrates:** Chest X-rays showing focal infiltrates are consistent with TB.**Important Note:** While PCP is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients,",A,"A 45-year-old HIV-positive male with a CD4 count of 400 cells/mL presents with a subacute onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Examination reveals diffuse redness throughout the eye with normal eyelids and a conjunctival lesion; there is no discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"Acute red eye with watery discharge, normal eyelids, and absence of itching is more consistent with viral conjunctivitis"
the red eye,"**E** Here's why:* **Anterior uveitis (iritis)** is characterized by localized redness, pain, and often a conjunctival lesion.Superficial pain without vision loss aligns with this condition.Let's look at why the other options are less likely:* **Corneal ulcer:** Would typically cause more severe pain, foreign body sensation, and potentially blurred vision.* **Scleritis:** Presents with deeper, more diffuse pain and often systemic symptoms.* **Acute angle-closure glaucoma:**Causes sudden, severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision.",D,"A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a red, painful eye. He reports superficial pain and no vision loss. Examination reveals localized redness and a conjunctival lesion.

What is the most likely diagnosis, and what further investigations should be considered?","Secondary amenorrhea evaluation -> Negative progestin challenge with positive estrogen–progestin challenge indicates anovulatory cycles -> Further evaluation should target causes of anovulation, such as PCOS, via endocrine workup."
weakness,"**E** Here's why:* **The key features are:*** Progressive weakness* Atrophy and fasciculations (indicating lower motor neuron involvement)* Diminished reflexes* No sensory deficits* **These findings strongly suggest a problem at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where nerves communicate with muscles.** Let's look at why the other options are less likely:* **A. Upper motor neuron lesion:** Would typically present with spasticity, increased reflexes, and weakness that affects both sides of the body.* **B. Spinal cord compression:**",D,"A 58-year-old male presents with progressive weakness in his right arm over the past 6 months. On examination, the patient exhibits atrophy and fasciculations in the affected arm, with diminished reflexes but no sensory deficits. What is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's weakness?","Chronic progressive LMN signs (atrophy, fasciculations) without sensory involvement are characteristic of ALS."
prevention and screening,"**D.** Here's why:* **Tricuspid stenosis** is the most likely cause of an early diastolic, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border that increases with inspiration.Let me explain:* **Early Diastolic Murmur:** This indicates blood flow obstruction during ventricular relaxation (diastole).* **Decrescendo Configuration:** The murmur gets softer as it progresses through diastole.* **Left Lower Sternal Border:** This location is characteristic of tricuspid valve sounds.* **Inspiration Increases Intensity:**Increased venous return during inspiration can",B,"A 54-year-old woman is evaluated for a diastolic murmur. The murmur is early diastolic with a decrescendo configuration, heard best at the left lower sternal border, and increases in intensity with inspiration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?",Patient with diastolic murmur -> Early diastolic decrescendo sound -> Right-sided murmur (increases with inspiration) -> Consistent with pulmonic regurgitation
